> Mike is not only a talented programmer but is also an effective and valuable
> collaborator. He stepped into leadership roles when necessary but was always
> a positive contributor to the group as a whole. While it is easy for those
> who are ahead to either intentionally or unintentionally leave others
> behind, Mike was always careful to keep everyone in the group on the same
> page and to provide guidance to teammates when necessary. I would be happy
> to work with him again any time. - Tyler Graham

> I had been hoping I would be able to work on a project with Mike Reeves,
> to be able to pick his brain, observe his process, and learn some new
> techniques from his years of experience as a developer. In every way,
> working with Mike exceeded my expectations but the most impressive thing
> about Mike is how much he cares about his team mates, and his conviction
> that we should have a showpiece project for employers. I learned a ton
> from Mike during an overnight pairing session at Turing that ended at 5am,
> where we combed over the app's features and made sure it deployed properly.
> Even after all that effort, Mike spent a weekend after the evaluation
> debugging the app, and submitted pull requests on all of the bugs we
> discovered during the evaluation and demo. I came out of the project feeling
> grateful for his hard work and impressed at what we accomplished because
> of it. - Jai Misra
