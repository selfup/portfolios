# Tyler Graham - M3 Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission

Coming into this module I felt weak particularly on the front end, so I made a commitment to focus more time on improving my stylistic html, css and JavaScript skills. This came into play on the API Curious project, where I devoted a significant chunk of the project work time to teaching myself css and animations as well as how to work with bootstrap and bootswatch.

Throughout the module I also referenced various tutorials (w3 schools, treehouse) and read much of the Wily Html & CSS book. In the end I feel that my efforts paid off, as I progressed significantly as a developer during the module but particularly in the area of front-end design.

### Attendance

I missed 2 days this module, one because of work and one because of illness.

### Projects

I completed the following individual projects this module:

#### Personal Project - "StockWatcher"

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tgraham777/stock_watcher)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/self_directed_project.md)

In this 2 week project I built a website that allows users to log in/authenticate with facebook and then add any stocks they are interested in to their "watchlist." When a stock is added, StockWatcher pulls data from the Markit On Demand API and displays it to the user, but also runs calculations on the data to provide a conclusion on the long-term and short-term trend of the stock's performance. It then uses these trends to issue a recommendation for each stock on a user's list, telling the user when to buy, sell, or hold. A user can also decide to "purchase" a stock, in which case the app records the purchase price and quantity purchased and tracks the profit and loss of the user's portfolio over time.

Evaluation comments: Trying to tackle the stock market was a bold move. Because the web scraper used in the project takes a while it would be best to have it run in the background to (or at least appear to) cut down on loading times when a new stock is added.

Evaluation scores:
+ Completion: 3
+ Organization: 3
+ TDD: 4
+ Code quality: 3
+ User experience: 3
+ Performance: 3

#### API Curious - "Git It & Quit It"

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tgraham777/git-it-and-quit-it)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/apicurious.md)

Git It & Quit It was my API Curious project. It consumed the GitHub API and used that data to reconstruct a user's Github profile page in a more user-friendly format.

Evaluation comments: "Very polished UI but unable to get it running on Heroku during evaluation"

Evaluation scores:
+ Completion: 2
+ Organization: 4
+ Test-Driven Development: 2
+ Code Quality: 3
+ User Experience: 3

## Team

### Projects

I completed the following team project this module:

#### The Pivot - SupperSkip

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mrjaimisra/the_pivot)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/the_pivot.md)

The Pivot was a group project in which our team used a legacy code base (a dinner dash project of one of the group members from the previous module) and modified it to meet new client demands. Working with an existing codebase (partuclarly in the context of database structure) was both valuable and challenging. It forced the group members to "think outside of the box" and to find new ways to solve problems.

Evaluation comments and scores:
+ Completion: 3: Team completed all the user stories and requirements set by the client.
+ Organization: 4: Team used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.
+ Test-Driven Development: 4: Coverage was good, showed understanding at all levels.
+ Code Quality: 3.5: Code was better factored than most, controllers were mostly skinny, wouldn't call it "Exceptional" though.
+ User Experience: 4: Project exhibits a production-ready and polished UX.

Team member feedback (paraphrased):
+ Overall Tyler was a valuable contributor
+ While not necessarily the strongest member of the group on either the front end or the back end, Tyler was involved and contributed on all layers of the project
+ Tyler improved the overall dynamic of the group and encouraged good team communication and workflow throughout the project

## Community

### Giving Feedback

I provided individual feedback to each of my teammates on The Pivot project. Each said that they felt the feedback was true (even when negative) and was valuable to their development at Turing. I also provided feedback to various other members of the cohort throughout the module, occasionally in terms of technical skills but most often in terms of teamwork and communication.

### Being a Community Member

I have openly received feedback from many other members of the cohort throughout this module. While most feedback was positive, some negative/constructive feedback involved my operation within a team setting and my tendency to get too focused on what I personally was working on. That feedback (mostly from The Pivot project) pushed me to become a more collaborative team member and to make sure that I play a valuable role in all layers of a project's development. Based on the feedback I received, I believe I improved my collaboration significantly by the end of the project.

### Playing a Part

+ On Friday, September 25th, I delivered a lightning talk on ways the "average" (non-finance-professional) person can use available software tools to engage in quantitative finance and algorithmic trading
+ I try, as much as possible, to contribute something unique to the Turing community, which in my case generally involves something finance-related; as such, I have interacted with various students regarding their financial positions and futures and have tried to lend a hand wherever possible
+ Throughout the course of the module I helped several Turing students get in contact with Qwinix Technologies (namely the Founder and CEO of Qwinix Technologies), a devops organization located in Greenwood Village, CO that has a strategic partnership with my company
+ I am in the process of setting up a presentation with the head of investments, head of private equity and head of quantitative analysis at my company to show them the stock watchlist app I've been working on and to explore ideas related to what we can do with free financial data available on the internet

## Review

### Notes

* Feeling good about the database side of things. 
* Keep up the good/hard work.
* Very good to have you in the group
* Knows how to take things lightly and have a great attitude. 
* Has leadership potential. Looking forward to seeing your progress. 


### Outcome

Pass
