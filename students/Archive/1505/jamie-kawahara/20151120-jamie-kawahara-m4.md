# Jamie Kawahara - Module 4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

The most important feedback that I received from my module3 review was that I needed to work on remaining calm when things go wrong.  My goal for this module therefore was to keep a healthy emotional perspective of things.  I feel I have greatly improved on my ability to keep calm and for the most part have been confident in my abilities to deal with stress.  I have even received multiple compliments by a module1 student that I am very calm.

### Attendance

This module I attended all days and classes on-time with the exceptions of when I visited a company in Boulder, had an interview and attended RubyConf.

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### Self-Directed Project: Scale Up

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/androidgrl/scaleup)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/the_scale_up.markdown)

In this project, the Scale Up, I optimized an existing project for performance and load. A few of the focuses of the project were:

* Handling a database with large numbers of records
* Handling heavy request volume/throughput
* Diagnosing and fixing performance bottlenecks (without compromising existing features)
* Monitoring production (error and performance) behavior of an application

#####Evaluation Scores
* Production Deployment and Performance Monitoring: 3
* Load Testing / User Scripting: 4
* Database Load: 3
* Performance Optimization Techniques: 3
* Additional Features: 3

#####Notes from Evaluator
* At 375 RPM, app was running at 175ms.
* load script hits all endpoints with some extra ones.
* caching of loan_requests done in controller
* caching in rendered partial
* nice use of rescue in the load script

## Team

### Projects

I participated in the following team projects:

#### Game Time

* [Production URL](http://androidgrl.github.io/othello/)
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/androidgirl/othello)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)

In this project we built the board game Othello that is playable in the browser. There was no server-side component- we used client-side JavaScript exclusively to complete this project.

The following goals were:

* Use client-side to drive both the design and implementation of code
* Use jQuery to traverse and manipulate the DOM
* Use test-driven design to build a client-side applicaiton

#####Evaluation Scores

* Functional Expectations: 4
* TDD: 3
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3
* Fundamental JS & JS Style: 3
* Code Sanitation (JSHint): 3

#####Notes from Evaluator

* Could use some polish on the front end.
* Suggested styling the welcome page and centering the board to start.
Extraneous "players" object, but good breaking out of objects.

#### Spinboard

* [Production URL](http://ancient-cliffs-8473.herokuapp.com/)
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/androidgrl/spinboard)
* [Original Assignment](https://gist.github.com/stevekinney/7423bf8d4a4a8622b386)

#####Evaluation Scores

* Satisfactory Progress: 3
* Ruby Syntax & Style: 3
* Rails Style & API: 3
* Javascript Syntax & Style: 3
* Testing: 4
* User Interface: 3
* Delivery Deadlines: 2

#####Notes from Evaluator

* Could use a back button on the edit page
* When logged in, you see all users links. Should be clarifed on the README
* Try to keep actions restful. Create say mark_controller and have an update action
* Nice organization of JavaScript files
* Wonder why when you sort the links, there's a giant block of white space

## Community

### Giving Feedback

#### Peer Feedback
Jamie is a competent and collaborative partner, able to stay on task and work through difficult issues while staying positive. Her optimistic outlook is infectious and it was easy to envision success while working on Othello with her. Thanks in large part to Jamieâ€™s resourcefulness and positive infuence, we were able to take a very daunting project and break it up into workable pieces. I would not hesitate to pair with her again.

### Playing a Part

* I ran a student-led workshop on 3D printing on the Lulzbot and making custom 3D printed business cards, which was based on a blog that I did for [Women in 3D printing](http://womenin3dprinting.com/2015/10/10/3d-printed-portrait-business-cards-tutorial/).
* I was available afterschool on Fridays to anyone who wanted to learn how to use the 3D printer.
* I gave a demo of 3D printing to the group of outreach high school students that visited.
