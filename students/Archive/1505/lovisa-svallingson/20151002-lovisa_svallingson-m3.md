# Lovisa Svallingson - M3 Portfolio

## Individual

### Mission Statement

This module I set out to work hard and push myself in this process without breaking myself. I want to support and learn from  students in the modules below me.

---

### Attendance

I have been present everyday except for three days at week 5 of the module. Two days I was working from home because we had project work time, and one day I was sick.

### Work

#### The Pivot

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/applegrain/the_pivot)

A multitenant crowd funding platform.

* Feedback from Dmitry:

```You’re super focused and get a lot of work done in a short period of time. You’re also very reliable, so I know if you say you’re going to do something you’re certainly going to get it done. Sometimes I feel like you push a little too far ahead with building out functionality that we may not need at the moment, instead of polishing out the code we already have. This has a tendency of diverging the group members understand of the entire project. So if I would like to pick up on something you left off, it becomes slightly difficult, which ends up deterring me from delving into certain parts of the project.

You’re very articulate, quick to pick-up new concepts, and easy to communicate with. I feel like you explain things well and more importantly are honest about the extent of your understanding. You don’t pretend to fully understand something but you explain the part you do understand very well. I also feel like you’re a good listener when I have your attention.

My only concern is it’s tough to hold your attention when you’re computer is open. When I try to explain something to you, I don’t feel like you always give me a chance to finish my thought before you go back to coding or focusing on your code. And I frequently end up questioning wether or not I got my point across. Besides that, I think you’re going to be an amazing developer. I would love to work with you in the future at Turing or outside of Turing!```

#### Scores

* Completion: 2: Team completed most of the user stories and requirements set by the client.
* Organization: 4: Team used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.
* Test-Driven Development: 4: Code coverage was good on both unit and integration level
* Code Quality: 3: Quality was high overall, but still had more logic in the controller than I would have liked
* User Experience: 4: Project exhibits a production-ready and polished UX.

#### APIcurious (otherhub)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/applegrain/APIcurious)

I used GitHub's API to show stats on commits, repos and followers. 95% of the front end was built with React.js.

* Completion: 4: Developer delivered all planned features plus 2 extensions.
* Organization: 3: Developer used a project management tool to keep their project organized.
* Test-Driven Development: 2.5: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>70%), but does not adequately balance feature and unit tests.
* Code Quality: 3.5: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.
* User Experience: 4: The application is a logical and easy to use implementation of the target application.

#### Rales Engine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/applegrain/rales-engine)

Sales Engine but on Rails. I'm not very happy with how this project went. I wasn't very engaged and was fousing more on "getting it done" and less time learning and reading about ActiveRecord queries.

* Completion: 4: Project completes all base requirements according to the spec harness.
* Test-Driven Development: 3: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>80%) and tests at the controller and unit levels. - BI tests are fragile. Testing just the response code and doesn't test the data given back.
* Code Quality: 3: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.
* API Design: 4: Project exemplifies API design idioms, with consistent and coherent response structures, serializers to format JSON data, and effective request format handling.
* Queries: 3: Project makes good use of ActiveRecord, but drops to ruby enumerables for some query methods. -A few BI methods are hairy. Multiple ruby enumerables, but other queries look good.

#### Personal Project

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/applegrain/PDC)
* [Production link](http://public-data-compiler.herokuapp.com)

The Public Data Compiler. A Node app with a React client and Express server

* Completion: 4 - Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set by the client in timely manner.
* Organization: 3 - Developer used a project management tool to keep their project organized.
* Test-Driven Development: N/A JavaScript porject. Didnt attempt testing.
* Code Quality: 4 - Project demonstrates exceptionally well factored code. - Node app. MVC not applicable
* User Experience: 4 - Project exhibits a production-ready and polished UX.
* Performance: ?? 4 - Project pages load on average under 300 milliseconds. Node app. React - did not install performance monitoring tool

### Playing a Part

I have been less active in the Turing community this module. Since we have been having more indidivual work
it has been more difficult to take a break and do other things than coding. I did organize a "movie night", showing a documentary about Aaron Swartz.

### Feedback

* from Penney:

```“I almost don’t have words for how much I appreciate Lovisa. Going through module 1 as someone who has never programmed before is intense (to say the least), and Lovisa came to the rescue on multiple occasions. She helped me lay out projects conceptually, refactor, start difficult projects, and gave much needed pep talks. The week that I broke down in tears she is the one that talked me through it and built me back up emotionally. She’s brilliant, patient, and a great teacher. Even when she has a ton of her own work to do she always took the time to help me through my questions. She also always makes a point of asking how I’m doing and letting me know she’s available. So grateful!"```

* from Sekhar:

```It was so great working with Lovisa on my team's headcount project. Penney and I had been jerked back and forth for a full week on whether to do a much heavier parse method or to stick with our instinct and do a lighter parse then build out strong methods. Lovisa's pairing session helped us think through top-level design and also refactor our up to 25-line methods down to 2-3 dense lines each. I really pinpoint that as the turning point of our project from "will we even finish phase 1/we are set to fail this project" to "wow, we are doing way better than we thought and have already done quite a bit of heavy lifting." Lovisa is excellent at refactoring, and she gave us momentum to finish this project strong. We just got assessed and we are very happy with the work we put forward. Thanks for all your help this module! PS Super impressed with the ruby interpreter you built in book club at Josh's.```

* from Jack Yeh:

```I was really tentative about joining 1505, and it took several week before I felt comfortable with my cohort-mates. Lovisa is one of the few bright spots. Early on and throughout the module, she made me feel welcomed and at ease. She works harder than anyone I know and also gives/teaches generously, cheerfully and patiently. We’re all lucky to have her here!```

* from Sam Brock:

```One of our Gear-Up exercises asked something along the lines of “Who do you most admire in your cohort and why?” It didn’t take long for Lovisa to come to mind. Lovisa constantly pushes herself with seemingly boundless energy. She is always going the extra mile on assignments, and working with mentors and staff. It’s simply amazing that she was able to build her self-directed project in Node and React, two technologies we haven’t even touched upon in class. As incredible as her coding accomplishments have been, I appreciate her contributions to Turing and the community even more. She put together the Aaron Schwartz documentary viewing, started the revival of the Turing podcast, and spoke at Boulder Ruby and Denver.rb to name just a few. If all of that weren’t enough, Lovisa is a great person to be around. Go Lovisa!```

## Review

### Notes

* Wanted to really focus on JavaScript. 
* Felt like Pivot was a bit repetative. 
* Enjoyed and thought ActiveRecord was interesting, but wanted some exposure before the project. 
* Got great feedback from so many people. 
* Pushes very hard. Does amazing work constantly. Aims for perfectionism. 
* Understand your limits a little bit more. Make sure you take care of yourself. 
* Taking time off from programming is ok. Find some outlets - you will never be a slacker. 
* Overall you're one of the best. You will do amazing things.
