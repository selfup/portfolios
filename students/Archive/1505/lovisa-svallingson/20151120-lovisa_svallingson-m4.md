### Playing a Part

This module I have been reaching out more to students in lower cohorts and been trying to pair as much as possible with them.
I feel like I always learn a lot when I am helping others, having to explain things you thought you knew reveals gap and helps
you understand it better.

I also held a few student led sessions at the beginning of the module which was a lot of fun.
