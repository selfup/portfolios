## Review

### Notes

* Focus was to learn course work. It was a busy module so no extra work. 
* Approach was different per project.
* Really took away how to work with APIs. 
* Difficult part of the pivot was implementing sidekiq. 
* Learned a lot about background worker. 
* Testing APIs was biggest take away. 
* Once you learn to stub Oauth it all went smoothly.
* Active record was a big take away. 
* Pleased with personal project. Learned a lot about twillio api. 
* Focus on code quality. You have a lot of potential and if you focus particularly on code quality you can be great. * Find a specialty or somethign you really care about to set you apart. Have that thing you can demonstrate almost an expertise with be rewarding personally and important for the job search. 
* Really inspiring community wise. We tend to forget about our outter community, but you really did well with this.
* Would like to see you try to engage more with the inner community here at Turing. Help some students in lower modules. Be a leader. 
* Really enjoy your resilience.
