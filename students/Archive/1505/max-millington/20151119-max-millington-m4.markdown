# Max Millington - Module3 Portfolio

### Areas of Emphasis

I spent most of the module learning about JavaScript, JQuery, and scaling. However, my primary emphasis was on job search.

### Attendance

I missed quite a few days for interviews.

### Work

These are the projects I worked on this module.

#### Snake

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/MaxMillington/snake)

I did this project with Dmitry. The goal was to learn OO JS and how to TDD it.

Steve evaluated us.

* Functional Expectations: 3
* TDD: 4
* Logic: 3
* JS Style: 3


#### Scale Up

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/MaxMillington/scale-up)

In this project, the goal was to fix a broken pivot app that had been populated with 500,00 records so that it would load
in a reasonable amount of time.

Horace evaluated me.

* Production Deployment and Performance Monitoring: 3
* Script Test: 3
* DB Load: 3
* Performance optimization techniques: 4
* Addl Features: 3

#### Real Time

* [GitHub URL]

I unfortunately didn't finish this project due to having to go to job interviews. However, I was able to get the sockets working and was able to create polls
that generated two links, one for the user and one for the admin.
I also learned how to do routes in node and learned about the ejs template.

#### Final Assessment

I also haven't taken the final assessment because I was in San Francisco interviewing and just got back today

## Community

### Giving Feedback

 I gave feedback to my group.   

### Playing a Part

* I delivered a lightning talk on job search
* I think I'm going to demo snake tonight.
* I spoke with lots of my peers and underclassmen about the job search and what I have been learning.
* I didn't do much else because module 4 has been very busy for me.
