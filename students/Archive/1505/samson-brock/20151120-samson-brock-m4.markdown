# Samson Brock - M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission

My mission for Module 4 is to balance job hunting and finishing strong in my
final module at Turing. I took time away from my self-directed project at the
end of Module 3 to focus on updating my resume and on other time-consuming job
hunt tasks. I want to re-focus on project work in Module 4 so I have something
to show off in my portfolio. Furthermore, I want to continue to contribute to
Turing in non-academic ways as well as start to learn non-curriculum skills such
as Elixir/Phoenix.

### Work

I completed the following individual projects this module:

#### Idea Box 2.0

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/imwithsam/revenge_of_idea_box)
* [Original
  Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/revenge_of_idea_box.markdown)

This was a practice CRUD app involving building an API and dynamically creating
views with JavaScript / AJAX.

Reviewed By: Jai Misra & Dave Maurer

- Features:
4: All of the base expectations were completed and as well as one or more
extensions
- User Interface:
4: The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use
- Rails Style:
4: Developer is able to craft Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, follow
the principles of MVC, and push business logic down where it belongs
- Ruby Style:
3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and
often extracts logical components
- JavaScript Style:
3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and
often extracts logical components

Additional comments:
Sam has a very good knack for finding useful tools and resources online.
Consequently, he was able to implement things like wait_for_ajax. Very
well thought out interactions between code and tests.

#### Game Time

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/imwithsam/turing-crush)
* [Original
  Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)

This was our first big JavaScript project. It involved creating a video game
using Webpack with Babel for ES5/ES6. My teammate for this project chose for us
to do a clone of the popular game, Bejeweled. I TDDed the back-end of the game
with Jasmine. The game was not completed. Unfortunately, Turing paired me with a
teammate who on past team projects had repeatedly demonstrated an inability to
work effectively with others. After trying out many different ways to try to
work with my teammate, I found myself with nothing to show for my efforts except
for the most stress I ever experienced at Turing. I reported these issues to
Turing in a timely manner, but in my opinion the situation was handled neither
timely nor properly by Turing. I ended up having to work on this project on my
own with only a small fraction of the time to work on it. This was a real
disappointment as Game Time was one of the main projects I wanted to focus on
for my portfolio in lieu of job hunting.

* Functional Expectations: 2: Application has some missing functionality but no
crashes
* Test-Driven Development: 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the
coverage is insufficient
* Breaking Logic into Components: 2: Application shows some effort to break logic
into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear
* Fundamental JavaScript & Style: 2: Application runs but the code has long
functions, unnecessary or poorly-named variables, and needs significant
refactoring

#### Scale Up

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/imwithsam/scale_up)
* [Original
  Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/the_scale_up.markdown)

This project involved taking a brownfield Pivot project from a previous cohort,
and analyzing its performance with New Relic, Skylight, Bullet, and Rails Mini
Profiler. I performed various performance enhancements such as pagination,
caching, and database access optimization. I was able to increase the
thoroughput and decrease the response times of the application quite
significantly. (Thoroughput was in the 500s and response times averaged below
150ms, even with my slow laptop running the load testing script. Originally, the
site would not even load after seeding the database with 500k+ records.) The
only area of improvement we could identify that I did not have time to make was
counter caching loan requests by category.

Instructor: Horace

Overall perf is quite solid; lots of throughput coming through

Good to see that the "tricky" / "slow" pages are actually filtering to the
bottom of the list showing that we optimized them pretty effectively

Got a good mix of some AR tricks, some fragment caching, and a bit of data
caching

Pagination is implemented and load script seems to be thoroughly exercising
various endpoints

* Production Deployment and Performance Monitoring: 3
* Load Testing / User Scripting: 3
* Database Load: 3
* Performance Optimization Techniques: 3
* Additional Features: 3

## Team

### Projects

I completed the following team projects this module:

#### Real Time

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/imwithsam/interpoll)
* [Original
  Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/real_time.markdown)

Rich web application that leverages WebSockets with Node.js and Redis to push
data to connected clients in real time.

TODO: Add rubric scores.

#### Mastery Project

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/imwithsam/spinboard)
* [Original
  Assignment](https://gist.github.com/stevekinney/7423bf8d4a4a8622b386)

SpinBoard is the final capstone assessment project for the Turing School of
Software & Design. It covers the major topics taught including Ruby, Rails, and
JavaScript.

TODO: Add rubric scores.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

I submitted written feedback to:

Beth Secor - "Beth came to Turing and took right to coding. I was impressed with
the knowledge and skills she demonstrated in just her first week at Turing. Beth
even had one of the warm-ups done before Warm Up. She continued to challenge
herself as a member of the Echo group in 1510, and I have no doubt she will
continue to be a strong student throughout the rest of her time at Turing.
Golick Posse is lucky to have her!"

Torie Joy-Warren - "Torie is a model Turing student. I've heard Jeff say she
takes on any challenge easily, and I've seen it in her willingness to learn
about and lead Code Retreat and Elixir meetings. In fact, she may already know
more about Elixir than anyone else at Turing."

### Being a Community Member

"Sam always asked me what we were up to in 1510 and always offered to help me
work through a problem on a project, despite the fact that he had so much work
to do himself. His positive attitude is infectious, and I have no doubt he will
be a great developer when he graduates." - Beth Secor

* I participated in Meetups including Code for Denver, Denver.rb, Boulder Ruby,
and DenverScript.
* I participated in RubyConf 2015, and will share my experience in a blog post.

### Playing a Part

* I led the organization of the Halloween festivities (decorating, food, and
  costume contest) for Turing.
* I organized a group hike to Hanging Lake on Monday, October 5.
* On Friday, November 13, I delivered a lightning talk "Elixir on Phoenix."
* I did little things at Turing like clean up, buy coffee, and make sure rooms
  were locked up at night.

## Review

### Notes

- Final project (Real Time) was not completed, despite affordances for additional time and working in a group.
- Game Time was not completed and did not meet the requirements.
- Final assessment was not completed by the deadline for passing.

### Outcome

RETAINED - your portfolio is lacking in one or more areas and you may either repeat the current module or leave the program
