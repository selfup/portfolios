## Individual

### Your Mission

My mission for Module 3 is to focus on getting better at Ruby on Rails. I have
struggled with wanting to learn different things and spreading myself too thin.
I am going to focus on the curriculum, and minimize distractions trying to learn
other things like Elixir on Phoenix, Swift, etc. I will also continue to be a
part of the local tech community by participating in Meetups and other events
whenever possible.

### Work

I completed the following individual projects this module:

#### API Curious (YouTwitFace)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/imwithsam/you_twit_face)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/apicurious.md)

In this project, I focused on consuming and working with data from public APIs.
I worked with the OAuth protocol (OmniAuth gem) for Twitter, and created a
limited-functionality Twitter clone.

Completion: 4: Developer delivered all planned features plus 2 extensions.
Organization: 4: Developer used a project management tool and updated their
progress in real-time.
Test-Driven Development: 4: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>90%),
tests at the feature and unit levels, and does not rely on external services.
Code Quality: 3: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.
User Experience: 3: The application covers many interactions of the target
application, but has a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

#### Rales Engine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/imwithsam/rales_engine)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/rales_engine.md)

In this project, I used Rails and ActiveRecord to build a JSON API which exposed
the SalesEngine data schema.

Completion: 2.5 - Code was good and well refactored. Overall good project but 4
failures 2 errors.
Test-Driven Development: 4
Code Quality: 3
API Design: 4
Queries: 2

#### Self-Directed Project (Walk This Way)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/imwithsam/walk_this_way)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/self_directed_project.md)

In this project, I mashed up the Yelp, Walk Score, and Google Maps APIs to
create a pedestrian-centric business directory.

Completion: 3 - Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set by
the client.
Organization: 3 - Developer used a project management tool to keep
their project organized.
Test-Driven Development: 4 - Project shows exceptional use of testing at
different layers (above 95% coverage).
Code Quality: 3 - Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.
User Experience: 3 - Project exhibits a production-ready user experience.
Performance: 3 - Project pages load on average under 400 milliseconds.

## Team

### Projects

I completed the following team projects this module:

#### The Pivot (The Ocho Tickets)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/imwithsam/the_pivot)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/the_pivot.md)

In this project, we built upon an existing implementation of Little Shop of
Orders. We transformed a carnivorous plant ordering site into a platform that
handled multiple, simultaneous businesses. Each business had its own name,
unique URL pattern, items, orders, and administrators.

Completion: 4: Team completed all the user stories and requirements set by the
client in a timely manner.
Organization: 4: Team used a project management tool and updated their progress
in real-time.
Test-Driven Development: 3: Project shows exceptional use of testing at
different layers (above 95% coverage). A couple of gaps were found.
Code Quality: 4: Project demonstrates exceptionally well factored code.
User Experience: 4: Project exhibits a production-ready and polished UX.

"Sam is a very strong developer. It was a pleasure to be on his team for the
pivot. Not only was he easy to work with but he was always available to answer
any questions that I had. I feel that I learned a lot just from being in his
group. I would really enjoy working with him again in the future."

## Community

### Giving Feedback

I submitted written feedback to:

David Shim
"I worked with David Shim on The Pivot project. Dave’s passion for developing
web applications shone through. He was always willing to go the extra mile on
the project, and do both the big and little things. We did really well on the
project, in no small part to Dave’s contributions. I would gladly work with Dave
again on any project."

Michael Dorrance
"Mike has made my experience at Turing a better one. His maturity makes him
easily relatable and enjoyable to work with and be around. He has excellent
people skills, and understands projects and users/clients at a higher level.
Mike is also passionate about front-end work which is reflected in his projects.
He has shared his passion for and knowledge of UX/UI and their related tools
through student-led sessions as well as individual mini-sessions. Mike will
undoubtedly make an excellent developer, project/product manager, and/or
business owner. I would work with/for him any day."

Lovisa Svallingson
"One of our Gear-Up exercises asked something along the lines of 'Who do you
most admire in your cohort and why?' It didn’t take long for Lovisa to come to
mind. Lovisa constantly pushes herself with seemingly boundless energy. She is
always going the extra mile on assignments, and working with mentors and staff.
It’s simply amazing that she was able to build her self-directed project in Node
and React, two technologies we haven’t even touched upon in class. As incredible
as her coding accomplishments have been, I appreciate her contributions to
Turing and the community even more. She put together the Aaron Schwartz
documentary viewing, started the revival of the Turing podcast, and spoke at
Boulder Ruby and Denver.rb to name just a few. If all of that weren’t enough,
Lovisa is a great person to be around. Go Lovisa!"

### Being a Community Member

I participated in Meetups including Code for Denver, Denver.rb, Boulder Ruby,
and DenverScript. I participated in the Hack the Arts Hackfest. I volunteered to
help out with Denver Startup Week.

"Sam is a real asset to our cohort because of his experience and calm approach
to looking for a solution. He is always willing to help with a question and
explain it so that you understand it. He is a great guy who is a team player and
always brings a positive attitude."
- Michael Dorrance

"Sam is an extremely hard worker and active supporter of the Turing community.
He is focused on the work at hand and commits to finishing projects."

### Playing a Part

On Wednesday, August 19, I organized a Denver Cruiser Ride social event.
On Friday, October 2, I delivered a lightning talk "O Arel, WHERE Art Thou? SQL
Querying with Arel"
I did little things at Turing like clean up, buy coffee, and make sure rooms
were locked up at night.

## Review

### Notes

* Take aways form Mod 3 - Focus on RoR. 
* Learning to work with a strict api was very enlightening.
* Rales_Engine - realized didn't know a ton about ActiveRecord. Would like more ActiveRecord support.
* Optimizing the speed of application was tricky. Was able to do some things to improve this. Was a good take away from the project. 
* Find something to differentiate yourself from other developers. Find your edge that can set you apart.
