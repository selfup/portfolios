# Alex Tideman - M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

Learning Javascript and becoming effective enough to build full apps using just Javascript and Node was the main goal of mine coming into Mod 4. I feel like I achieved that goal,
and am comfortable turning to Node for new apps. I also focused on creating cleaner code on the first pass and to think more about overall design before diving into the code.

### Attendance

This module I attended all days and classes on-time with the exception of Friday, October 31st.

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### Mastery Project

GitHub: https://github.com/Alex-Tideman/final_assessment
Production: https://spinboard-final.herokuapp.com

This was our final assessment to see if we had mastered the necessary skills and development patterns
to see if we could complete a CRUD app with client-side interactions.

* Satisfactory Progress: 4
* Ruby Syntax & Style: 4
* Rails Style & API: 4
* Javascript Syntax & Style: 4
* Testing: 4
* User Interface: 4
* Delivery Deadlines: 4

#### Real Time

GitHub: http://www.github.com/Alex-Tideman/pollster
Production: https://pollster-me.herokuapp.com

This project's objective was to utilize web sockets to create a real-time web application that allowed users
to poll others and get live updates on poll results. Also had to deal with time differences between user and server.

* Javascript Code: 3
* Organization: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Code Quality: 3
* User Experience: 3
* Features Completed: 3


#### Scale Up

GitHub: http://www.github.com/Alex-Tideman/keevah

This project tested our abilities to load large amounts of data into our production database and use traffic monitoring tools to see how
fast each page loaded. We used several techniques for speed improvement, including caching, advanced ActiveRecord queries and pagination.

Feedback:
* 225ms at 300 rpm
* related projects was cached
* good use of database queries
* could have cached database counts, and looked for opportunities to create and cache static pages


* Production Deployment and Performance Monitoring: 3
* Load Testing / User Scripting: 3
* Database Load: 3
* Performance Optimization Techniques: 3
* Additional Features: 4


## Team

### Projects

I participated in the following team projects:

#### Game Time

In this two-week long project Adam and I recreated the classic arcade game Asteroids using only pure Javascript.
We incorporated both object-model and functional programming styles to create drift physics, AI for shooting aliens, collision detection and increased difficulty.
Definitely the most fun project I've participated in and the one I'm most proud of.

It was evaluated by Tess with the following results:

GitHub: http://github.com/Alex-Tideman/asteroids
Production: http://alex-tideman.github.io/asteroids

Feedback: Realized early on to make it object oriented, looks great.

* Functional Expectations: 4
* TDD: 4
* Breaking Logic into Components: 4
* Fundamental JS & JS Style: 3
* Code Sanitation (JSHint): 3


### Feedback to Me


## Community

* I was a member of the Student Advisory Board that met every Thursday to discuss the happenings of Turing and to understand how we can make Turing a better place.
* I was a member of Young Entrepreneurs that met every Tuesday to build an app for a child's small business. I created an admin backend for Jack's Stands.

### Giving Feedback

* Gave feedback to every person in cohort in survey and those that asked on Slack.

### Playing a Part

* Any time I stayed late I would seek out someone to help or offer advise on how to approach their project.
* On Friday, October 23, I delivered a lightning talk "Getting Started on Meteor".
* I helped several 1507's implement Materialize, Semantic UI and other front-end frameworks
on their personal projects.
