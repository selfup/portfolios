# Alex Tideman - M3 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

I was really excited about the Individual project going into this module and to dig deeper in the more complex feature of Rails as well as JSON and APIs. I also was interested in starting to grasp Javascript/AJAX/JQuery and I spent a lot of individual time practicing it this module. Going forward I want to work on better UX, refactoring controllers as much as possible, and getting much better at Javascript and AJAX.


### Attendance

This module I attended all days and classes on-time with the exception of an
absence on Friday, September 4th.

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### Effortful

GitHub: http://www.github.com/Alex-Tideman/effortful
Production: https://be-effortful.herokuapp.com

My personal project was a Rails app that provides those in need a chance to perform position actions in the community and receive non-monetary rewards from sponsors. It utilizes Google Omniauth, Google Javascript/Maps/Directions API and What3Words API to create user-specific routes without addresses.

* Completion: 4
* Organization: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 4
* Code Quality: 3
* User Experience: 3
* Performance: 4


#### Rales Engine

GitHub: http://www.github.com/Alex-Tideman/rales_engine

Rale Engine was a recreation of Sales Engine, but in Rails and we had to create JSON endpoints for API consumption. I think I did an exceptional job
on this project by utilizing a lot of ActiveRecord queries and almost no ruby methods. I tested it very well and was confident in the data I was producing and it's format.

Feedback: Great looking code. 100% test coverage. 100% complete. Only 1 ruby method in queries.

  * Completion: 4: Project completes all base requirements according to the spec harness.
  * Test-Driven Development: 4: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>90%) and tests at the controller and unit levels.
  * Code Quality: 4: Project demonstrates exceptionally well factored code.
  * API Design: 4: Project exemplifies API design idioms, with consistent and coherent response structures, serializers to format JSON data, and effective request format handling.
  * Queries: 4: Project makes great use of ActiveRecord relationships and queries, including some advanced query functionality such as joins and includes.


#### APICurious

In this week-long individual project, I consumed API data from Instagram and used Omniauth to create a new
experience for Instagram users. I delivered 2 extensions and had thorough test coverage.
It was evaluated by Jorge with the following results:

GitHub: http://github.com/alex-tideman/flashbulb
Production: https://flashbulbz.herokuapp.com

  * Completion: 4: Developer delivered all planned features plus 2 extensions.
  * Organization: 4: Developer used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.
  * Test-Driven Development: 4: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>90%), tests at the feature and unit levels, and does not rely on external * services.
  * Code Quality: 3: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.
  * User Experience: 4: The application is a logical and easy to use implementation of the target application.



## Team

### Projects

I participated in the following team projects:

#### The Pivot

In this two-week long project my team pivoted an existing Rails app to create a auction-based e-commerce site.
We were the only group to integrate background works with both email and Twilio to update users on auction results.
It was evaluated by Jorge with the following results:

GitHub: http://github.com/MaxMillington/the_pivot
Production: http://collectors-world.herokuapp.com

  * Completion: 3: Team completed all the user stories and requirements set by the client.
  * Organization: 4: Team used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.
  * Test-Driven Development: 4: Code coverage was fine in SimpleCov, there were clearly tests that didn't actually excercise the edge cases. It's an iffy 4, but I do still feel like they understand the concepts expected.
  * Code Quality: 3: Emails being sent from user model, models too fat overall, controllers has more logic than I would have liked. Overall quality was pretty good, but I wouldn't call it exceptionally well factored.
  * User Experience: 3: Project exhibits a production-ready user experience.

### Feedback to Me


## Community

* I was a member of the Student Advisory Board that met every Thursday to discuss the happenings of Turing and to understand how we can make Turing a better place.
* I was a member of the Friday Outreach group that visited a handfull of non-profits and NGOs to better understand the communities issues and to listen to how technology could improve their members.
* My personal project is a product that can directly help those in need in our community. I am really proud of it and want to further improve it.

### Giving Feedback

* Gave feedback to all members of The Pivot group
* Gave feedback to every person in cohort in survey and those that asked on Slack.

### Playing a Part

* Every morning I assisted with my Posse mates on the warmup problems and helped out with any of their projects when needed.
* Any time I stayed late I would seek out someone to help or offer advise on how to approach their project.
* On Friday, September 25, I delivered a lightning talk "Immersive Journalism with VR"


## Notes
* Really wanted to be able to create an entire Rails app on his own. Really worked hard practicing Rails. Feels really comfortable now using Rails
* Would have liked to practice more ajax and JS.
* Wants to practice refactoring and code quality a little more.
* Had a great pivot group and really enjoyed working with them.
* Felt empowered now that he can use APIs.
* Great attitude all the time.
* Personal project was a personal win. It was something he wanted to do before coming to Turing
* Can take any challange and not be overwhelmed.
* Can figure anything out.
* Have a great calm energy.
* Focus on optimizing code quality. Do things in the best way possible. Refactoring - expressivness in the code.
* Complexity doesnt bother you, but complex isn't ideal. We write code for others and our future selves.
* Focus on purposful features. What value does it have? What do I need to do for this user to be able to succeede using my app.
