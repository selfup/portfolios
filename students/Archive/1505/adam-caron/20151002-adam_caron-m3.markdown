## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

This module, I set out to become more comfortable carving out my own features to work on, develop, create, and take responsibility for. I set out to do things on my own with more confidence and with a greater sense of ownership.

### End of Module Assessment

There wasn't an end-of-module assessment for 1505 in Module 3.

### Attendance

This module I attended all days and classes on-time, prepared to learn and eager to participate.

### Work

#### API-Curious

* [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/adamcaron/api_curious)
* [Production URL](http://api-curious.herokuapp.com/)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/apicurious.md#technical-expectations)

After our poor Pivot evaluations, I set out to redeem myself and produce exemplary marks on API-Curious, completeing all features and deliver a solid product. I'm proud of how my results for this project.

Jorge said, this was my "redemption project". "Great job not taking-on too much."


Completion: 3 - Developer delivered all planned features.
Organization: 4 - Developer used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.
Test-Driven Development: 4 - Project demonstrates high test coverage (>90%), tests at the feature and unit levels, and does not rely on external services.
Code Quality: 4 - Project demonstrates exceptionally well factored code.
User Experience: 4 - The application is a logical and easy to use implementation of the target application.

#### Rales Engine

* [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/adamcaron/rales_engine)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/rales_engine.md)

I'm proud of how I did on this project. While I would have felt more comfortable if we had a class on *advanced ActiveRecord quesries*, I'm still glad with the reults I produced. I learned a lot about testing controllers and continuously referrenced this project for controller tests well after this project was complete.

**Scores / Project Eval**

Completion: 3 - Project completes most requirements but fails 5 or fewer spec harness tests.
Test-Driven Development: 4 - Project demonstrates high test coverage (>90%) and tests at the controller and unit levels.
Code Quality: 3 - Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.
API Design: 4: - Project exemplifies API design idioms, with consistent and coherent response structures, serializers to format JSON data, and effective request format handling.
Queries: 3 - Project makes good use of ActiveRecord, but drops to ruby enumerables for some query methods.

#### Personal Project: Whatchu Talkin' Bout?

* [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/adamcaron/whatchu_talkin_bout)
* [Production URL](whatchu-talkin-bout.herokuapp.com)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/self_directed_project.md)

I'm proud for having delivered a whole and complete, minimal-viable-product. What I developed is solid and has a lot of room for additional features.

Completion: 3 - Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set by the client.
Organization: 4 - Developer used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.
Test-Driven Development: 4 - Project shows exceptional use of testing at different layers (above 95% coverage).
Code Quality: 3 - Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.
User Experience: 3 - Project exhibits a production-ready user experience.
Performance: 3 - Project pages load on average under 400 milliseconds.

### Projects

#### The Pivot

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/adamcaron/the_pivot)
* [Production URL](http://way-out-there.herokuapp.com/)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/the_pivot.markdown)

The Pivot was one of my favorite projects. I learned a lot because we had to dive into an existing code base of a Rails appliaciton. This forced my to truly understand how the code was working. This project I believe skyrocketed my understand for Rails and increased my comfort level and confidence as a developer.

This project received poor marks because our production application was broken during the evaluation. I learned a valuable lesson about feature delivery. The projects I worked on after this (later in module 3) reflect how I learned to deliver a working production application.

**Scores:**

Completion: 1 (bugs with permissions)
Organization: 2 (because missed checkin)
UX: 2 (gaps in UX)
TDD: 1
Code Quality: 3


## Community

### Giving Feedback

"Jack is one of the most thoughtful, knowledgable, and pleasant team member's I've worked with. During our project, Jack had to leave town for the weekend. Halfway around the world, he was communicating with us, submitting pull requests with meaningful contributions, and participating in team meetings: more than anyone could ask from a team member. I've learned a lot working with Jack and thoroughly enjoyed having him as a classmate."

"You use a different git workflow than I do, which I don’t fully understand. On the pivot, there were a couple times when what was on your local master and what was on the remote master were somehow in conflict and I’m not sure how that happened."

"Another thing to work on, if last night you were up all night, perhaps working at the beginning of the project to define what needs to get done, set deadlines for those things, and stick to them could prevent all nighters."

"These two things are super nit-picky. I really had to stretch and think about it because honestly, you’re a great developer with a fantastic attitude towards learning, and I look up to that."

"Also, you’re personal project was fucking sweet. UI was amazing and functionality was all there, so the fact that you were up late last night is pretty minor."

### Playing a Part

On 9/18/2015 I delivered a lightning talk that taught people how to use PivotalTracker to become better students and more productive developers.

Worked with Lovisa and Adam Jensen to produce an application called, ['Tidy Up'](https://github.com/adamcaron/tidy_up). This application is mean't to serve Turing in the process of posse-cleanup duties.

I paired frequently with 1508 students, like Bret, Adam, and Jeff.

I paired every week of the module with my mentor, Troy Denkinger. We practiced Ruby together and touched upon general programming topics. Our relationship has helped me be a better developer and more effective classmate.

## Review

### Notes

* Focused on really carving out a piece of functionality and taking ownership for it. 
* Took a lot away from Pivot and was very helpful. Learned a ton about rails
* Important to identify technically risky things and know they may be an issue. 
* Don't mess with production code at the last minute. 
* Wanted active record class before rales engine
* Personal project was a good lesson. Pivoting mid project was difficult but very valuable to see real world scenarios. Proud of personal project. 
* Did a great job at improving on mistakes and having upward trends in things that initially didn't go well.
* You take feedback well. Listen to it and incorporate it. 
* Going forward - focus on tackling hard things. Develope an 'expertise' or spike in a particular knowledge. If you're just an average developer it will be hard to find a job... "Why should I hire this average dude?" 
* Try to improve in algorythmic thinking. DSA
