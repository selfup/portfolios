# Adam Caron - M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission

This module, I set out to develop my algorythmic thinking, refine my technical skills, and delve into a specific technology that would differentiate me from other programmers. To fulfill this goal, I ...
 - Solved Euler problems with my mentor every week this module (as per Josh Cheek's recommendation)
 - Adopted a challenging and technically-difficult 'Game Time' project
 - Practiced with React JS on various projects and learned this technology that I would not have learned in class.

### Work

#### Idea Box 2.0

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/revenge_of_idea_box.markdown)
* [Production URL](https://box-o-ideas.herokuapp.com/)

**See also:** 'Idea Box: React' -- refactored version of Idea Box 2.0 with React JS. [GitHub URL](https://github.com/adamcaron/idea_box_react)

A simple application for recording and archiving ideas. This app is a project for the Turing School of Software and Design.

Throughout the project, one of the focuses will be on providing a fluid and responsive client-side interface. To this end, javascript and jQuery is relied upon to implement snappy filtering in the browser, and AJAX to enable inconspicuous communication between client and server.

This app features:
 - Rails to manage data related to our ideas and serve initial UI templates
 - Javascript (with jQuery) to manage client-side interactions and communicate asynchronously with the server

I was rather proud of this project for the quality and clarity of the code I wrote. It was the perfect stepping-stone and introduction to clientside development.

**Grading**

Reviewed By: Alex Tideman

**Scores:** 34444
- Features:
3: All of the base expectations were met
- User Interface:
4: The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use
Awesome interface with notifications and animations to direct the user to do what is asked.
- Rails Style:
4: Developer is able to craft Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, follow the principles of MVC, and push business logic down where it belongs
Super clean, simple Rails controllers that utilized a lot of Javascript for the heavy lifting
- Ruby Style:
4: Developer writes code that is exceptionally clear and well-factored
Very clean Ruby code, keep any logic or conditionals in the model.
- JavaScript Style:
4: Developer writes code that is exceptionally clear and well-factored
Really well organzied, clean code that does a lot of the functionality and complex stuff. Really fast and accurate.

**Additional comments:**
Excellent project, lots of great Javascript code, clean look and feel, simple Rails and Ruby to follow. Overall an awesome job.
One area of improvement would be to add Selenium to do feature tests of Ajax and other Javascriptings.

#### Scale Up

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/adamcaron/scale-up)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/the_scale_up.markdown)

Scale an existing Rails app, optimizing for performance and load. A few of the focuses of this project are:
 - Handle a database with large numbers of records
 - Handle heavy request volume/throughput
 - Diagnose and fix performance bottlenecks (without compromising existing features)
 - Moniter production (error and performance) behavior of an application

The original application is already deployed to production, and the goal is to keep them that way, add new features and improve performance while avoiding downtime.

This app is designed to comfortably handle hundreds of requests per minute with an average response time below 100ms with 600+ RPM (and below 200ms with 400+ RPM).

In order to evaluate the performance of this application, it can be exposed to heavy load via a load-testing script which exercises as many of the application's endpoints as possible.

In addition to handling heavy request load from users, this application handles database load against a db with large numbers of records. To do this, the various tables in the DB was seeded with lots of records.

An additional goal for this project was to utilize multiple caching techniques along with sophisticated query optimizations and combinations.

__Instructor:__ Horace

__Repo:__ https://github.com/adamcaron/scale-up

* Developed some tools and techniques
* Good mix of optimization techniques; some markup caching; some
data caching to help out with slow pagination counts
* Would have been cool to see this same technique extended to the category
pages, which would probably have made a large difference in overall app
performance

**Scores: ** 33333
1. __Production Deployment and Performance Monitoring:__ 3
2. __Load Testing / User Scripting:__ 3
3. __Database Load:__ 3
4. __Performance Optimization Techniques:__ 3
5. __Additional Features:__ 3

### Projects

#### Game Time

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/alex-tideman/asteroids)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)
* [Production URL](http://alex-tideman.github.io/asteroids)

Build a game that is playable in the browser. There was no server-side component for this project. This app used client-side JavaScript exclusively to complete this project.

Alex and I chose Asteroids primarily because we were excited to build such a rad game! It was technically challenging yet extremely rewarding to build (and fun to play!). It also appealed to us because no other students from Turing had ever built this game before.

__Instructor:__ Tess

* Nice to see it live online
* Extension was multiple levels
* Realized early on to make it object oriented, looks great.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

In addition to feedback forms submitted for Dmitry, Alex, and Erik, I also focused to give constructive, supportive feedback for each of my classmates throughout the module.

According to the Feedback application:
  * I delivered 100% of the requested feedback

### Feedback to me

**Comments:**

"Adam is able to think through complicated concepts due to attention to detail and great organization. He naturally thinks in a linear pattern and likes to go step by step, which is a huge boon when dealing with software that requires the correct format and sequence. He is also a pleasure to work with, and has a collaborative manner. I would want him on any team I was assigned to." - Dave Maurer

"You're pleasant to work with and pleasant to be around. ... Keep up the great work, you certainly have a bright future ahead!" - Anonymous

### Playing a Part

 - Was a 1505 representative for the Student Advisory Board, solicited and communicated meaningful feedback on behalf of my classmates.
 - Attended Improv every week this module.
 - Delivered a lightning talk on October 30th, 2015 on SASS and paired with Justin Holzman on his personal project afterwards to help him design the frontend of his app.
 - Attended field day, supported the community and had a great time with my classmates.
 - Eagerly attended each of the Lunch Roulette lunches this module and enjoyed learning more about my classmates
 - Paired with a mentor from my Possee every week this module.

## Review

### Notes

Adam's Real Time project was not successful, but it was an outlier in a portfolio of otherwise successful performance.

### Outcome

PROMOTED - your portfolio demonstrates a successful fulfillment of expectations and you may move on to the next module or graduate
