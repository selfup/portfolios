# Michael Dorrance - Module 3 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

Coming out of Module 2 my goal was to continue performing well on group projects while taking on challenging aspects of each project to continue to grow individually.

## Team

### Projects

The team project in Module 3 was a great experience.

“It was a pleasure to work with Mike on the pivot. He’s definitely one of the hardest working people I’ve seen at Turing. Mike was always more than willing to pair on a part of the project and when he was assigned individual work he always got it done promptly. Besides the coding part of the project, he is also always enthusiastic and brought a lot of good energy to the team. I would definitely work with him again!"  - Mitch Ashby

"Mike was an extremely valuable member of our Traffic Spy team, he was positive, thoughtful and driven throughout the project. He has a great skill of preparing visuals and mockups to build our vision before actually creating it. He has a great passion for development and his enthusiasm to solve problems spreads to all team members. I look forward to working with Mike again!" - Rob Cornell

## Individual

#### Apicurious

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mdorrance/instaclone)
* [Production](https://sharefeed.herokuapp.com)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/apicurious.md)

* **Completion**: 4: Developer delivered all planned features plus 2 extensions.
* **Organization**: 4: Developer used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.
* **Test-Driven Development**: 4: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>90%), tests at the feature and unit levels, and does not rely on external * services.
* **Code Quality**: 4: Project demonstrates exceptionally well factored code.
* **User Experience**: 3: The application covers many interactions of the target application, but has a few holes in lesser-used functionality

#### Ralesengine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mdorrance/Rails_Engine)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/rales_engine.md)

* **Completion**: 4: Project completes all base requirements according to the spec harness.
* **Test-Driven Development**: 4: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>90%) and tests at the controller and unit levels.
Code Quality: 3: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.
* **API Design**: 4: Project exemplifies API design idioms, with consistent and coherent response structures, serializers to format JSON data, and effective request format handling.
* **Queries**: 4: Project makes great use of ActiveRecord relationships and queries, including some advanced query functionality such as joins and includes.

#### Adventurrin - Self-direct Project

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mdorrance/adventurrin)
* [Production](https://adventurrin.herokuapp.com)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/self_directed_project.md)

* **Completion**: * 4: Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set by the client in timely manner.
* **Organization**: * 4: Developer used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.
* **Test-Driven Development**: * 3: Project shows adequate testing (90% - 95% coverage).
* **Code Quality**: * 3: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.
* **User Experience**: * 4: Project exhibits a production-ready and polished UX.
* **Performance**: The api calls are the long waits in this app. UX was compensated with a nice loading page to make sure that the user is aware something is happening. On the controllable side times were better and faster. * 2 - Project pages load on average under 500 milliseconds.

When we look for place to visit or vacation, we always tend to ask our friends what they have done. Then we usually emulate them. So for my personal project I integrated Instagram for Oauth and User Feed because "Seeing is Believing" and the photos are the best and most inspiring. Adventurrin filters your current feed to only display photos with locations. I then took the Lat/Long and sent it to Google Static Maps api for directions and mapping and the Yelp api to display the top 3 food suggestions for the location of the photo. All data resided on the page through modals, each with different data. The UX gain was an expensive process for data consumption. No adventure begins without directions and ends without food. You can then save an adventure for future completion.  

I integrated location search by first parsing the input through the Google Geocoding api then sending the results to Instagram, Google Maps and Yelp. This is a time consuming process out of my control but the value is worth the time. I tested it with users and they found the results to be accurate, valuable and said that they would use the app.

I really enjoyed the project and look forward to learning more about JS front-end frameworks in Module 4 to create a faster user experience since I built in essence a single page app in Rails and Bootstrap.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

I provided feedback on every weekly survey.

### Playing a Part

I thought it would be beneficial for the Module 2 students to get awareness to wireframing tools and techniques before Traffic Spy, so I led a student session on Friday August 28 titled:
* Breaking down problems with wireframes (Student-led session, 2-4pm)
  - Gain an understanding of the REAL user stories
  - Introduce wireframing tools and techniques
  - Lets break down the user stories with the classic project "Traffic Spy"
  - Build a clickable wireframe of Traffic Spy using Balsamiq
* [Gist for the Class](https://gist.github.com/mdorrance/0542aa31b9328bf80c9c)

I participated in the first Turing Kids Who Kid session on Saturday September 12, 2015. It was a lot of fun to engage and work with the kids. They had great enthusiasm so it was easy to explain concepts and challenge them to think differently to tackle the problem.

## Review

### Notes

* Building something real that people can use - That's the real value of an api.
* ActiveRecord ActiveRecord ActiveRecord 
* Nice ability to take on something challenging and the unknown and just work towards accomplishing something. 
* Learned the value of front end JavaScript frameworks with personal project. Did not use one and had painfully slow load times. 
* Great scence of product. 
* Good job getting more experience with the backend. 
* Develope that thing that will set you apart from the rest of the applicants.
