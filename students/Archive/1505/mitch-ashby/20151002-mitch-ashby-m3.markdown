#**Mitch Ashby - Module 3 Portfolio**
Individual

###**Areas of Emphasis**

This module I really wanted to work on learning new technologies on my own and experimenting with different ways to do things.

I was here every day except for one of the all day work days in which I worked from home.

###**Projects**

I completed the following projects for this module:

####**Pivot**

GitHub URL: https://github.com/mitchashby16/the_pivot
Original Assignment: https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/the_pivot.markdown
Production: https://farmers-market-pivot.herokuapp.com/

In this two week long project I was team lead. We pivoted a nursery e-commerce website into a multi-tenant farmers' market
website. 

Completion: 4: Team completed all the user stories and requirements set by the client in timely manner.
Organization: 4: Team used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.
Test-Driven Development: 3
Code Quality: 3
User Experience: 4: Project exhibits a production-ready and polished UX.


####**APIcurious**

GitHub URL: http://github.com/mitchashby16/instapic
Original Assignment: https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/apicurious.markdown
Production: instapic-ashby.herokuapp.com

Completion: 4: Developer delivered all planned features plus 2 extensions.
Organization: 4: Developer used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.
Test-Driven Development: 4: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>90%), tests at the feature and unit levels, and does not rely on external * services.
Code Quality: 3.5: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.
User Experience: 3.5: The application covers many interactions of the target application, but has a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

For this individual project, I cloned instagram using the instagram api. A user can use omni-auth to login to the site and see their instagram feed as well as search for trending posts or by tags.

####**Rails Engine**

GitHub: http://github.com/mitchashby16/rales-engine
Original Assignment: https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rales_engine.markdown

Completion: 3: Project completes most requirements but fails 5 or fewer spec harness tests.
Test-Driven Development: 4: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>90%) and tests at the controller and unit levels.
Code Quality: 3: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.
API Design: 4: Project exemplifies API design idioms, with consistent and coherent response structures, serializers to format JSON data, and effective request format handling.
Queries: 4: Project makes great use of ActiveRecord relationships and queries, including some advanced query functionality such as joins and includes.

###**Feedback**

Feedback I received :

Michael Dorrance 1505 -> “Mitch took the role of project manager and ran with it. He truly lead my example through his planning, listening and delegating. The team stayed on task, focused, learned and had fun. Mitch is a natural problem solver and tackles any challenge head on. His code quality is great and he is happy to explain and show how he approached the solution. I would absolutely work with Mitch on any project at Turing or professionally in the workforce."

Robert Cornell 1505 -> "Mitch was a lot of fun to work with.  He is focused and well versed in a number of topics.  Mitch likes to work more independently, but one of the things I liked is that when we did work in a group or as a pair, Mitch was not overbearing or difficult to work with, as I’ve experienced in the past.  He would explain his thinking as he went or explain if asked.  I enjoyed working with Mitch and would gladly work with him on a project again."


###**Playing a Part**

Throughout the six weeks I spent a lot of time helping other people. I also try to be friendly to everyone even if I am stressed due to a project.
During week 2 I spent a lot of time pairing with people on Traffic Spy.
During week 2 I helped to organize a camping trip for the weekend.

## Notes

* Goal was to find unique ways to do things.
* Time management was something that was taken away from the Pivot particularly in regards to being in a group. 
* Good take away. Not all APIs are created equal.
* Still shaky on testing JavaScript. Would like to learn this. 
* Personal project got the worst scores of the module, but felt like he got to most out of it.
* Helped out on trafficSpy for mod 2. 
* Continue helping others and being a part of the community. 
* Continue being a group leader. Your reaching out to the outter community is excellent. Try to bring that back into the inner community too. 
* Keep building on the 'spikes' of your knowledge.
