# Drew Conly - M3 Portfolio

##Individual

###Areas of Emphasis

This module was quite a wild ride. As the emphasis was much more personal than
module 2, my goal was to become more confident chasing errors, taking a concept
to reality, and hone my knowledge of Rails and its peripherals throughout.

###Community

###Giving Feedback

I provided feedback for all team members for respective projects as well as for
those from other cohorts that I've paired with.

###Playing a Part

* Delivered a lightning talk concerning the technical staffing industry as I
  was involved in each facet of it for the 4 years prior to Turing.
* Organized a camping trip to both Nederlands and later to Twin Lakes near
  Leadville, CO with 6 other students from various modules attending.
* Aided a former Turing student and good friend to land a new job with a
  former colleague of mine; she is doing quite well already!
* Took on additional education in addition to code in the form of awareness of
  pertinent industry issues.

###Review



###Notes

* Wanted to build something significant in Mod 3. 
* Increase comfortability with Rails. 
* Pivot was a big challenge. Group was a unique dynamic. Thought he could have doen a better job keeping group on track. Project came down to the wire and just didnt deliver on time. 
* API Curious - Consuming data is a powerful thing. 
* Biggest challenge for Rales_Engine was the api calls and SQL/ActiveRecord.
