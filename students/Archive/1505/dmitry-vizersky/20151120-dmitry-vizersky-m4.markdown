# Dmitry Vizersky - Module 4 Portfolio

### Mission

Coming into module-4 I felt really excited to learn more about JavaScript. I knew the basics but still had no idea how to test, build a web-app, or make something usable. I also set out to successfully complete every single project, including the front-end. After completing the Game-Time project I felt very comfortable with Object Orientated principles in JS and unit testing with mocha and chai. Building a real time Node/Express app using web-sockets was the most challenging project for me this module, and I felt I produced a great app in a very limited amount of time.

## Work

### Team Project

#### SnakeTime

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Dmitry1007/snake-time/tree/master)
* [Link To Game](http://dmitry1007.github.io/snake-time/)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)

Max and I teamed up for two weeks to build a wicked awesome version of the classic game, Snake! We TDD'd the whole way and only hooked up HTML5 canvas after we finished all of the business intelligence. We had a total of 46 passing unit tests by the time we finished.

* Functional Expectations: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 4
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3
* Fundamental JavaScript & Style: 3

#### Feedback To Me From Max

I appreciated that you understood that I had to do a lot of job stuff during the project, and I think I learned a lot and we ended up writing good code by the end despite this. I think the only thing that could have made or project better would have been if Steve gave us that OO talk before the project started instead of three days after. Once we got on the right track everything was fine.

### Individual Projects

#### Bro You Web-Scale?

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Dmitry1007/keevah)
* [Link To App](https://scale-up-keevah.herokuapp.com/)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/the_scale_up.markdown)

The goal of this project was to take an existing web-app(Keevah Micro-Lending) that was not optimized for performance and scale it up to an app that can handle hundreds of requests per/minute without crashing or taking forever to render pages. We used tools like NewRelic, Skylight, and Bullet to measure app performance and pinpoint bottlenecks in our code.

* Production Deployment and Performance Monitoring: 3
* Load Testing / User Scripting: 3
* Database Load: 3
* Performance Optimization Techniques: 3
* Additional Features: 3

##### Assessment Notes

* Getting comfortable with various techniques at a basic level -- some view caching, removing slow queries, fixing N+1's, etc
* Would like to see some more targeted caching around important app data
* Would like to see more diligent attention to preserving existing functionality (e.g. related loan requests - how can we keep these coming from the same category; pagination -- how can we cache the counts on categories and loan request so we don't have to COUNT(*) from big tables each time)
* Overall perf and throughput is in a good range

#### Real-Time

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Dmitry1007/real-hammer-time)
* [Link To Web-App](https://real-hammer-time.herokuapp.com/)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/real_time.markdown)

In this project, I build a real time Node applications with WebSockets. When the server gets new information, it pushes it out to all of the connected clients. My theme was centered around student polling. A teacher creates a poll, sends a link to all of her students to the poll voting page, and views student responses in real time.

* Code Style:  3
* Client Side: 3.5
* TDD:         3
* Concepts:    3
* Interface:   4
* Features:    3

## Community

### Giving Feedback

filled out every single survey, except 1, and tried to give constructive feedback. Provided personal and project feedback for multiple classmates.

### Being a Community Member

_Jeff Ruane, posse member_: You’ve been a great posse member, I thought it was great how you always wanted to not just solve the warmups, but solve them in novel ways. You’re always curious, always learning new things, and always pushing yourself, and I really respect you for that. Thank you for your constant willingness to help! Good luck, Dmitry!

### Playing a Part

* Volunteered to help Rachel conduct Q&A with a group of 30+ middle/high shcool students
* Attended Turing field day to Ace and whooped Adam's butt in ping-pong
* Every weekday, invited a hand full of different Turing students to lunch
* Had lunch with at least 45% of Turing students, and almost 100% with Rob
* Helped a few module-1 students with completeMe project
* Made effort to make myself available for help

## Review

### Notes

Not only did Dmitry ship every project. In the second half the module, he shipped confidently.
