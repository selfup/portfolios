# Dmitry Vizersky - Module 3 Portfolio

### Mission

Coming into this module I stubburnly set out to complete each project no matter how much time I had to invest, work life balance had to be put to the side. I also commited to write at least 2 technical blog posts and present 1 technical lightning talk. Along with writing blog posts, I decided to become more aquanted with the WordPress application. I just wanted to self-host my blog, have full control over the style and layout, and take advantage of the powerful admin features. Being very intrested in the front-end pushed me to obtain a far more comprehensive understanding of Bootstrap, JavaScript, and Jquery. Considering front-end development means I had to learn more about the asset-pipeline as well. My personal project, which is so rad, is composed of 80% Javascript. And I solved some of the morning challenges in JS as well.

## Work

### Team Project

Marla, Lovisa and I started with an existing single-tenant application from 1505's dinner-dash and built CodeStarter.
CodeStarter is a multi-tenant web-application for software companies to present their
dream projects and solicit needed funding from registered users.


* Completion:      2, Team completed most of the user stories and requirements set by the client.
* Organization:    4, Team used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.
* TDD:             4, Code coverage was good on both unit and integration level
* Code Quality:    3, Quality was high overall, but still had more logic in the controller than I would have liked
* User Experience: 4, Project exhibits a production-ready and polished UX.

#### Feedback To Me From Marla
I had a really great experience working with you. It's obvious how much you care about making beautiful products. I felt intimidated by the front end before this project but I don't feel that way anymore and it's because you took time to show me a lot about Bootstrap.

Like you mentioned, we both have strong personalities so sometimes it was tough to come to an agreement on how to approach a problem. On the positive side, it was awesome that our disagreements were always productive and civil and based in fact. We did have to undo some design choices after the fact, and I think a lot of the annoyance and pain of that could have been mitigated by having design discussions as a team before implementation. It felt difficult to gain your trust at the beginning of the project but this went away quickly and I think we had a great dynamic during the project.

If given a choice on a future project, I'd pick you again as a teammate. I will definitely be coming to you with front-end questions on my personal project too. I think you are already having a positive impact on our cohort and I'm glad you're here.

#### Feedback To Me From Lovisa
I really enjoyed working with you. First I was a bit worried that we were going to have conflicts or disagreements within our group since all three of us are pretty strong-willed but I think it went really well! Whenever we disagreed about the design of our back-end or the front-end we discussed it like adults instead of being stubborn babies.

I like working with you because you are very direct and arenâ€™t afraid of saying it the hard way instead of tip toeing around the subject and wasting time. Feeling that you were very direct with made it easier for me to be very direct back.

You work very hard and I learned a lot from you in terms of design and front-endy stuff. I would love to work with you again!

## Community

### Giving Feedback

filled out every single survey, except 1, and tried to give constructive feedback. Marla and Lovisa were my teamates for the pivot. I submitted earnest detailed feedback for both of them. I also took time to navigate Adam's personal project and provide detailed feedback on ways to improve user experience.

### Playing a Part

* For Traffic Spy, helped Regis build and sort a Hash of payload url's
* Helped many fellow students with CSS issues

* Learned a lot of JavaScript and jQuery during personal project.
* Has a great drive and motivation and desire. 
* Has been working really hard. 
* Could improve with self management. Take breaks and be more self aware of your physical and mental state. Don't want to burn out and become unfunctional.
