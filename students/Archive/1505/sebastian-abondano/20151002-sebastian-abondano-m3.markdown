# (Sebastian Abondano) - (M3) Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)
Coming into this module I wanted to focus on:
* Empowering others as a project (per Jeff’s recommendation at the end of Mod 2)
* Exercisms to improve Ruby 
* Rails & APIs per Mod 3’s schedule
* Exercising

Other:
* Recorded a screencast on building FizzBuzz in Elixir and posted it on blog.
* Submitted solutions to 6 new exercisms. 1 per week.
* Ended up jogging, going to the gym, or mountain biking approximately 3 times a week throughout this module.
* Details on 'empowering others as a project (per Jeff's recommendation at the end of Mod 2) are on the 'Playing a part' section of this document.
 

### End of Module Assessment

(Notes & scores from your assessment rubric)

The self directed project was the end of module assessment for this module.


### Attendance

This module I attended all days and classes on-time.


### Work

#### (APICurious)

* [GitHub:](https://github.com/sabondano/api_curious)
* [Production:](https://immense-thicket-5283.herokuapp.com)

Completion:              4: Developer delivered all planned features plus 2 extensions.
Organization:            4: Developer used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.
Test-Driven Development: 4: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>90%), tests at the feature and unit levels, and does not rely on external * services.
Code Quality:            4: Project demonstrates exceptionally well factored code.
User Experience:         4: The application is a logical and easy to use implementation of the target application.

#### (RalesEngine)

[GitHub:](http://www.github.com/sabondano/rales_engine)

100% completed. 100% test coverage. Added a serializer. Code could have been refactored a little more. A few larger methods. A few spots with ruby in queries.    

* **Completion**:              4: Project completes all base requirements according to the spec harness.
* **Test-Driven Development**: 4: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>90%) and tests at the controller and unit levels.
* **Code Quality**:            3: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.
* **API Design**:              4: Project exemplifies API design idioms, with consistent and coherent response structures, serializers to format JSON data, and effective request format handling.
* **Queries**:                 3: Project makes good use of ActiveRecord, but drops to ruby enumerables for some query methods.

#### (Self Directed Project)

[Github:](http://github.com/sabondando/episode_hunt)
[Production:](http://protected-inlet-4900.herokuapp.com)

* **Completion**:              4 - Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set by the client in timely manner.
* **Organization**:            4 - Developer used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.
* **Test-Driven Development**: 3 - Project shows adequate testing (90% - 95% coverage). - Had 98% coverage but only had one model test. Good testing overall.
* **Code Quality**:            3 - Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.
* **User Experience**:         4 - Project exhibits a production-ready and polished UX.
* **Performance**:             4 - Project pages load on average under 300 milliseconds.


## Team

### Projects

I participated in the following team project:

#### (Pivot) Auction App

Sebastian, Max, Alex

* [GitHub:](http://github.com/MaxMillington/the_pivot)
* [Production:](http://collectors-world.herokuapp.com)

Completion:              3: Team completed all the user stories and requirements set by the client.
Organization:            4: Team used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.
Test-Driven Development: 4: Code coverage was fine in SimpleCov, there were clearly tests that didn't actually excercise the edge cases. It's an iffy 4, but I do still feel like they understand the concepts expected.
Code Quality:            3: Emails being sent from user model, models too fat overall, controllers has more logic than I would have liked. Overall quality was pretty good, but I wouldn't call it exceptionally well factored.
User Experience:         3: Project exhibits a production-ready user experience.


## Community

### Giving Feedback

(feedback from me)
Filled out all end of week surverys.

Throughout my daily interactions and at retros I attempted to give more constructive feedback to both peers and instructors than I did in module 1 and 2. This is something the staff asked me to work on at portfolio review in module 2.

## Review

### Notes
* Tried to sork with others more. 
* What gets measured matters. You heloing others matter because you started to monitor it. 
* Pivot was a good expierence but challanging because all group members were very strong. 
* Really enjoyed trying to mimic twitter for apicurious was a really cool thing and something he really enjoyed. 
* Felt like a lot was learned and was very cool to get to a point that you can build something real and applicable.
* One strength was deliberate features for a purpose. 
* Continue helping others and participating in the community.
* Could be very valuable and a leader in the community - but you need to try to do that and maintain.
