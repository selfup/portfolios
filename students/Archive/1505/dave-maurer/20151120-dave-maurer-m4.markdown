# Dave Maurer - M4 Portfolio

### Areas of Emphasis

Testing was a weak point for me, and I've concentrated on using test driven development in all projects this module.
Interview prep is also an area I wanted to become better at, and I have engaged Travis Haby fro mmy posse along with
Aaron Greenspan in working through codewars challenges and warm ups in at least two different ways each day, along with
spending extra time in the mornings working on selected exercises, such as the fibonacci sequence and linked lists. This
has helped immensely with my code-related reasoning skills. I am working my way through the you don't know JS series, which
I purchased for kindle on Amazon. It is very informative, and has helped a lot with programming concepts that apply to more
than just Javascript. I am 40% of the way through scopes and closures now.

### Work

Individual Projects:

####Scale Up

Repo: http://github.com/davemaurer/keevah

Notes:

500ms at about 100 rpm
Categories only used includes, could use pagination and caching.
load script only really achieves sub 100 rpm.
understanding of the various techniques on how to improve performance has been achieved, just needs to combine them to bring performance up, or time down.

Production Deployment and Performance Monitoring: (1 - 4): 2+
Load Testing / User Scripting: (1 - 4): 3
Database Load: (1 - 4) 3
Performance Optimization Techniques: (1 - 4) 2
Additional Features: (1 - 4) 3

Takeaways: I loved this project, as I really like optimizing things. Unfortunately I'm not really good at it yet. I will
tinker with this one for practice and the enjoyment of seeing the numbers go down.


## Team

### Projects

Group Projects:

####GameTime

This project focused on object oriented javascript with open ended options for rendering. We chose to use a canvas.
Back end logic was the most difficult challenge.

Group members: Jamie Kawahara, Dave Maurer

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/androidgrl/othello)
* [Production](androidgrl.github.io/othello)

Could use some polish on the front end.
Suggested styling the welcome page and centering the board to start.
Extraneous "players" object, but good breaking out of objects.

__Functional Expectations:__4
__TDD:__3
__Breaking Logic into Components:__3
__Fundamental JS & JS Style:__3

### Feedback to me

From Jamie Kawahara: Dave was a delight to work with on Othello.  It was the most fulfilling project that I’ve worked
on at Turing because we paired the whole time and worked together.

From Adam Caron: Dave is one of the most supportive classmates I’ve had the pleasure of learning with. He is thoughtful
and always has a good word to say. Dave and I paired together on many projects and in addition to being a helpful and
reliable teammate, he’s simply a great person to be around. Back in Module 1 he was one of the first ‘upperclassmen’ to
reach out to me and help me feel supported and I believe Turing is a better place for Dave having been here.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

I have not participated in every survey this module, in part due to the restructure of Fridays which emphasizes more
opportunities to learn, and electives I am extremely engaged with. Also, I think this has been my bonding module with a
lot of the 1505ers. I didn't start out with them, so I've taken every opportunity to go to lunch or have conversations
with fellow cohort members. On the other hand, some of the changes I've seen at Turing echo the suggestions I've been
giving. I know I'm not the originator and/or sole reason for any of these changes, but I'd like to think I did my part
and helped things like the split groups in module one, the more structured lesson plans, and the clear examples given
at the end of instructor led sessions come about. I also pride myself in giving honest feedback, even if it causes
discomfort or runs counter to the norm. Turing means a lot to me, and I truly spend a good amount of time thinking
about how to make it better.

### Playing a Part

My niche is the Posse. I think a posse can be a large influence on student perception and comfort level at Turing,
especially early on. Kay Posse is the most involved, engaged Posse at Turing, of that I have no doubt, and I feel I've
been a large part of setting the standards and expecting a group oriented Posse culture. The benefits of this are many,
but some of them are:
1. A safe place to ask for help or advice
2. Balancing sentiment toward the Turing institution and a forum to work out possible issues or negative viewpoints. Posse
   members are able to keep each other grounded and shared perspective helps give clarity and eliminate snap judgements.
3. A forum for knowledge share and positive reinforcement for small individual accomplishments.
4. A support group for personal issues and emotional stability.
5. A sense of belonging within Turing, which translates subtly to a feeling of belonging to the larger community of Turing.

Apart from the Posse, I always try to spread positivity and help others keep perspective about projects, deadlines, and
life in general. I encourage those who want to teach things, and am sure to compliment those who attempt things that stretch
them out of their comfort zones, or make an impact. Just a few compliments here and there can be the difference between
feeling appreciated and continuing, or feeling like it's not worth it and stopping. I like to help push people toward the
former outcome whenever I can, and actively seek opportunities to do so.

## Review

Turing has been a life changing experience for me. Because Turing exists, I was able to see a path to the world of programming.
A path that would not have been possible to envision otherwise. Because of the passion and commitment at Turing, both on the
staff side and the student body side, I was able to progress through a learning curve that would have stopped me cold at week
one in a normal academic environment.

I am very grateful for all of the time and effort that went in to my time here, and I feel lucky that events unfolded in such
a way that Turing became a thing I was aware of, and then a thing that I'm a part of. Whatever I'm doing 20 years from now
Turing will have a lasting impact on the way I think, learn, and interact with others.

Specific to Module 4, I've learning a lot about Javascript, and programming structure in general. Being able to do FizzBuzz,
in Javascript, on the spot while white boarding, and then finding out that what I whiteboarded works the first time when
running from the console, is something I would not have said I could do before this module. In fact, I would advocate teaching
a little bit of Javascript each module after one, to let students get a feel for functions. Once they see the similarities
between Ruby and JS, I think it will help them to understand better what the data is, and what is being done to it when the
code executes.
