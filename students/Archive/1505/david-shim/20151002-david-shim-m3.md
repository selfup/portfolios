# David Shim - M3 Portfolio

### My Mission

  After learning basic rails in module 2, I tried my best to learn as much as possible and apply those skills to the projects that I have worked on.  While I enjoy working in groups, it was a nice change of pace to have mainly individual projects.  I believe they helped me focus in on my deficiencies and learn much more.  I hope to apply these skills to get a job in the near future and now feel confident that it can be accomplished.  I pushed myself harder this module than I probably ever have and hope that my results reflect this.

### Projects

## Team

  I completed the following group projects for this module:

#### The Pivot

  * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/imwithsam/the_pivot)
  * [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/the_pivot.md)

  In this two-week project we inherited a code base from another group's "Little Shop of Orders Project".         It was challenging to make all of the necessary changes while maintaining as much of the original code as possible.

  * Completion: 4 - Team completed all the user stories and requirements set by the client in timely    manner.
  * Organization: 4 - Team used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.
  * Test-Driven Development: 3
  * Code Quality: 4
  * User Experience: 4 - Project exhibits a production-ready and polished UX.

##### My Contribution

  With this project, I tried to work on as many aspects as I could. However, I spent a significant amount of time on adding multitenancy, the admin functionality, and the orders functionality.  However, I did try to work on every part of the project.  This should be reflected in the github contributions statistics.

##### Takeaway

  * Learned how to work with an inherited code base.
  * Learned how multitenancy can be implemented.
  * Learned the value of focusing on UX and code quality.
  * Learned that SimpleCov doesn't always represent full test coverage even though it's at 100%.
  * Focused on efficient project management while working with others.

## Individual

  I completed the following individual projects for this module.

#### APIcurious

  * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/dsshim/bithub)
  * [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/apicurious.md)

  This 2-3 day project was the first time that we consumed an external API.  Also, it was the first individual project since module 1.  It was a great introduction to the basics of pulling data from an external resource.  This is clearly a valuable skill that will be used in almost any project that I will work on in the future.

##### Takeaway

  * Learned how to consume an API.
  * Learned how to troubleshoot OAuth errors.
  * Learned to parse and use JSON.
  * Focused on time management when working with new concepts on a limited amount of time.

#### Rales Engine

  * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/dsshim/rales_engine)
  * [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/rales_engine.md)

  This 2 day project was focused on using advanced ActiveRecord queries with the same data and schema from out Sales Engine.  The most challenging part of this project was time management.  I did not have that much experience using queries such as joins and includes.  It was also nice to see how powerful ActiveRecord can be.

  * Completion: 3.5 - Developer delivered all planned features.
  * Organization: 4 - Developer used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.
  * Test-Driven Development: 4 - Project demonstrates high test coverage (>90%), tests at the feature and         unit levels, and does not rely on external * services.
  * Code Quality: 2.5 - Project demonstrates some gaps in code quality and/or application of MVC principles.
  * User Experience: 3 - The application covers many interactions of the target application, but has a few   holes in lesser-used functionality.

##### Takeaway

  * Learned how to use advanced ActiveRecord queries.
  * Learned to efficiently manage time between writing quality code and just getting something working.
  * Experienced the advantage of using ActiveRecord over Ruby.


#### Personal Project - MediCost

  * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/dsshim/medicost)
  * [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/self_directed_project.md)

  This 2 week project focused on building a professional quality Rails web app.  This project has been by far the most challenging and the most rewarding at the same time.  Being able to create a functioning web app based on my own idea was a powerful experience.

  * Completion: 3 - Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set by the client.
  * Organization: 3 - Developer used a project management tool to keep their project organized.
  * Test-Driven Development: 4 - Project shows exceptional use of testing at different layers (above 95%   coverage).
  * Code Quality: 3 - Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.
  * User Experience: 4 - Project exhibits a production-ready and polished UX.
  * Performance: 3 - Project pages load on average under 400 milliseconds.

##### Takeaway

  * More practice with advanced ActiveRecord queries.
  * Learned to import and maintain a large database with over 160,000 entries.
  * Learned how to incorporate AJAX and JQuery into a rails app.
  * Learned how to integrate multiple APIs into a single rails app.
  * Learned how to use caching to increase performance.  

## Community

### Giving Feedback

  * To Sam Brock(The Pivot): "Sam is a very strong developer. It was a pleasure to be on his team for the pivot. Not only was he easy to work with but he was always available to answer any questions that I had. I feel that I learned a lot just from being in his group. I would really enjoy working with him again in the future."

### Being a Community Member

  From The Pivot:

  * Sam Brock:  "I worked with David Shim on The Pivot project. Dave’s passion for developing web applications shone through. He was always willing to go the extra mile on the project, and do both the big and little things. We did really well on the project, in no small part to Dave’s contributions. I would gladly work with Dave again on any project."

  From Pairing with other Students:

  * Justin Pease:  "I'd love to give David Shim a big thank you.  He spent a number of hours with me helping me learn rails.  I do very well with one on one instruction and I am grateful David was able and willing to spare some of his time to help me.  He was really good at leading me to solve the problems myself and learn the material instead of just telling me the answers.  Thanks David!"

### Playing a Part

  I tried to become more active in the community by spending more time with classmates outside of school and volunteering for side projects set up by my peers.

  * On Saturday, September 26th, I helped George with his "Kids who Code" session.
  * On Friday, August 28th, I assisted Regis Boudinot deliver his student led session on DevOps/Setting up a Linux VM
  * On Friday, October 2nd, I gave a lightning talk discussing the future of the Internet in Space
  * On Thursday, October 1st, I presented my personal project "MediCost" at Demo Night.
  * On Tuesday, September 8th, I attended Denver RB
  * I will be participating in the "Young Entreprenuers" program on October 13th.
  * I will be participating in the project for homeless shelters/charitable orgs led by Mitch, Alex and Max

## Notes
* Mission for Mod3 was to solidify rails and learn active record. Really be able to use them in real world applications
* Felt like he put in a lot more effort this module. 
* "This is what Ill be doing professionally - I should probably know what I'm doing" - Dave
* Pivot was a good project. Inherited a good codebase which was nice. Not many issues witht the inherited code base. Multitenancy was tricky, but it was good to learn. Felt good to build a platform that is reminisant of a real world application. 
* Main challange of personal project was interpreting and translating business language for the app. 
* Really excited to see all the community involvment. 
* Would like you to try to work a lot in code quality. You have improved on this already, but there is still room to grow. This will slow you down in the long term but it will help tremendously with your growth as a developer. 
* Your UX is polished and well thought out.
