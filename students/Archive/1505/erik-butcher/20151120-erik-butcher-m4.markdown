# Erik Butcher - M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

In previous modules I've sometimes struggled with balancing time commitments. Here in Module 4, especially, with the job hunt on the horizon, that had become even more of a problem. Ultimately, I determined that trying to job search while doing projects would not work for me, and I feel like I've done better since making that decision.

I've also still been struggling with distraction, and I've been working on that as well.

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### Game Time: Switchblock

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/with-a-k/switchblock)
* [Production URL](http://with-a-k.github.io/switchblock/)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)

In this week-and-a-half project, I made a simple Bejeweled-alike in Javascript. While I was initially assigned this a pair project with Sam, we broke up; despite this I was able to complete the project on time.

Tess evaluated the project, giving it the following scores:

* Functional Expectations: 3
* TDD: 3
* Breaking Logic Into Components: 4
* JS Fundamentals & Style: 3
* Code Sanitation & JSHint: 3

#### Scale Up: Keevah

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/with-a-k/keevah)
* No longer up on production, as I needed the slots for projects on my people.turing.io profile
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/the_scale_up.markdown)

In this week-and-a-bit project, the goal was to improve the performance of an existing project (and add a couple features). I was not successful at this, in large part because I struggled breaking the project into actionable items, and because one particular performance drain became a rabbit hole due to its extreme use of time comparative to other pieces of the project.

Mike evaluated the project, giving it the following scores:

* Production Deployment and Performance Monitoring: 1
* Load Testing/User Scripting: 3
* Database Load: 3
* Performance Optimization Techniques: 2-
* Additional Features: 1

#### Real Time: PollStar

* [GitHub URL (client)](https://github.com/with-a-k/poll-star)
* [GitHub URL (server)](https://github.com/with-a-k/poll-star-notifier)
* [Production URL](https://poll-star.herokuapp.com)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/real_time.markdown)

In this week-and-a-bit project, I created a simple polling app using websockets. I chose to use a Rails frontend and database and have a Node server on the side handling pushing events to clients, unlike everyone else in the cohort.

Steve evaluated the project, giving it the following scores:

* Code Style: 2
* Client-Side Application: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 1
* Encapsulation: 3
* Concept: 2
* Interface: 2
* Features: 2

## Team

### Projects

There were no team projects this module, so to speak.

### Feedback to Me

I haven't received very much feedback, but what I have gotten includes this:

-"You have a great attitude and sense of humor. You're open to constructive feedback and always seeking to improve yourself. I've seen you improve tremendously since we've known each other."
The submitter has also recommended that I look for "a supportive team of programmers you're excited to work with" when I apply for jobs.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

I completed the single Feedback App request that was sent to me.

### Playing a Part

On 11-06, I gave a lightning talk on the EventListener in Javascript.
I attended every Tuesday afternoon improv class this module. I enjoy going to them a lot, and they're useful for both my development as a person and as stress relief.
