George Hudson - M2 Portfolio
============================


Individual
----------------------------
###Areas of Emphasis
I did not want to take my great scores (besides my nemesis: SalesEngine and SalesEngine
the SQL) from Module 1 and get complacent. I have tried many things in order to
keep my own motivation up to keep pushing myself. I have to remind my girls every once
in a while why I am seeing so little of them lately. In the long run, things will
be much better this way.

Since I have felt comfortable with the material, I have focused on being a better
team member in a group. I found it valuable to set group and individual goals at
the beginning of a project and to revisit those goals from time to time. Especially
during Little Shop, for instance, I noticed that both Adam Jensen and Jerrod Junker
wanted to do a lot of pairing but had not done much of it before the final weekend
before the project was due. I made it a point to pair up with Adam and invited Jerrod
multiple time to pair up. Unfortunately, Jerrod had personal issues arrise that made
this difficult. I tried to reach out to him and was well received and just let him
know that I can understand how one's personal life can interfere with one's success
at Turing.  


###End of Module 2 Assessment

Assessed By: Andrew Carmer

Notes: George worked quickly and knew almost everything we went through before I
  had to   explain anything. When we conversed about something that we were unsure about he collaborated well and got things quickly.

  Although we ran out of time to really push logic down the stack he said early that he wanted to try to do it which showed me he was aware of the concept. I was overall really impressed with George's rails knowledge and comfortability with doing everything.

Scores:
* Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking: 4
* Ruby Syntax & Standard Library: 3
* Rails Syntax & API: 3
* Rails Style: 3
* Testing: 3
* Collaboration: 4

###Just For Fun

####Blackheart
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Egogre/blackheart)

This is a project I hope to implement over my time at Turing. It has been something I keep *intending* to make, but never dedicate enough time to. I use different branches to explore topics we cover in class as well as my own personal online/mentor inquiries. If I like those branches, I merge them into master. It is not graded. I use it just for a fun way to continue practicing my Rails. I restarted this from scratch recently 
to see how long it would take me to build up to the point I had got to and was almost
disappointed with how little it felt like I had accomplished before!


Team
--------------------------------------
###Projects
I worked on two team projects this block:

####Traffic Spy
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mbburch/traffic-spy)
* [Original Assignment](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/traffic_spy.html)

Assessed by: Mike Dao

Assessment notes:

* Good pulling out of things into partials
* Methods in controller were a little heavy and could stand to be refactored
* Good use of helper classes
* More logic could be pushed to the models
* Design was pleasant
* JSon works, and campaigns work
* 38 tests

Scores:

* Functional Expectations: 4
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Encapsulation / Components: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 4
* Sinatra / Web and Business Logic: 4
* View Layer: 3

personal note: We mobbed through almost all of this project, which forced me to
  work on my communication skills. Everyone on my team was patient with each other
  and committed to learning and to turning out a good project. Only on the last
  night, when we were confident in getting a solid 3 on functionality, did we each
  try to implement our own extension and each person produced, giving us that 4.
  Great team.  

####Give-N-Get(Little Shop)
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/plato721/givenget)
* [Original Assignment](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/traffic_spy.html)

Assessed by: Josh Mejia

Assessment notes: Liked our POROs and callbacks and pushing logic down the stack
  in general. Was excited about the features we implemented and the workflow we used.

Scores:

* Feature Completeness: 3.5
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Controllers: 4
* Views: 4
* Models: 4
* Useability: 3
* Workflow: 4

personal note: As far as work strategy, this project was vastly different than
  traffic-spy. Much of this was divide and conquer, but we kept in regular
  communication and our workflow was on point so this ended up being an asset and
  also just as enjoyable to work with the team as traffic-spy was.


Feedback to Me
--------------------------------------

While we were not supposed to solicit feedback, I am including feedback I
received from MB. After she told it to me person to person, I wrote it down
because it seemed to be highly accurate and useful!
"You have a tendency to slowly stop talking through what your doing when you
'get lost' in coding." She also suggested that during those times, I hand over the keyboard, forcing myself to talk through my thought processes. I implemented this
idea well during the traffic spy project and recognized the same trait showing up
during Little Shop. When I noticed it, I handed over the keyboard, but need to
get better at realizing when I am narrowing my focus so much that I stop talking.


Community
-------------------------------------

###Giving Feedback

I usually take more time on the feedback forms than is allotted because I try to put
forth real feedback. This is mostly due to me feeling like Turing actually puts
this solicited feedback to use. I have filled out each form asked of me that I am
aware of.  

###Playing a Part

* http://turingwithgeorge.tumblr.com is still ongoing. I have tried to add both
  technical information as well as "the turing experience." Though I have tried
  to post about a post per day, I am 2 1/2 weeks behind this goal. Despite this,
  I have well over 50 posts about my time at Turing so far.
* I interviewed with Course Report in their Aulumni Spotlight section which can
  be read here: https://www.coursereport.com/schools/turing#/reviews
* I started up and lead the Turing Kids Who Code community classes. My motivations
  for this were:
    1) I wanted to teach my daughters how to program and kept putting it off (it
      was always easier to play games with them!). By making myself accountable
      to a slightly larger community, I prioritize my preparation more.
    2) I feel Jeff has given me a great opportunity and I wanted to find some way
      to pass that spirit of giving on.
    3) I wanted to get experience talking in front of groups and teaching.

    * I realized before starting it would be a difficult undertaking to take this
      on, especially with time constraints. What I did not understand was how much
      of a leadership role this would put me in. I find myself trying to organize
      and lead the other students interested in helping out. I feel in this area,
      (which is my weakest of those talked about) is where I will benefit the
      most from heading up Turing Kids Who Code.


### OUTCOME

## A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations.

* 4: Student achieved two or more "4s" on the assessment

## B: Individual Work & Projects

A Turing student works to maximize their skill growth and demonstrates
that skill across a variety of work.

* 4: Student demonstrates excellent growth by not only achieving satisfactory
evaluations for each project but also pushing their learning beyond expectations.

## C: Group Work & Projects

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, and delivers a high-quality product.

* 4: Student consistently helps their teammates be their best selves, learn at
an accelerated pace, and achieve great results.

## D: Community Participation

A Turing student builds up the community around them by participating and
supporting other students, the larger Turing family, and persons outside our
walls who want to develop their own skills.

* 4: Student has a significant positive impact on the learning and spirit of the
people around them.

## E: Peer & Instructor Feedback

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.

* 3: Student consistently delivers meaningful feedback for peers and implements
strategies to improve themselves in response to feedback.
