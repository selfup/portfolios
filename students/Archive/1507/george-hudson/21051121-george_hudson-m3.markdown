George Hudson - M3 Portfolio
============================


Individual
----------------------------
###Areas of Emphasis
This was a tough module for me. I felt the depression I have suffered creeping
back in. This is probably due to me testing my personal boundaries as to how much
extra I could take on while still doing well in class and in my projects. I knew I
would be pushing myself by adding in regular teaching sessions on Fridays to learn
and teach Swift on top of stepping up my responsibilities for Kids Who Code meetup.

Next module I plan to take one step back. I still would like to lead Kids Who
Code, but would like to organize it to the point where someone from an earlier class
can take over the reins when I have completed the program. Depending on the situation,
however, I might like to stay involved. It has been a highly rewarding experience.
I do not plan to teach regular Friday student led sessions though.


###Personal Project

Assessed By: Jorge Tellez

Github: N/A (private repo for schoolrunner.org)

Notes: Good use of JavaScript. Polling data to update views. Clean abstractions.

Completion: 4: Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set by the client in timely manner.
Organization: 4: Developer used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.
Test-Driven Development: 4: Project shows exceptional use of testing at different layers (above 95% coverage).
Code Quality: 4: Project demonstrates exceptionally well factored code.
User Experience: 3.5: Project exhibits a production-ready user experience.
Performance: 4: Project pages load on average under 300 milliseconds.

Personal note: This project was very different than other projects for me. MB and
I worked at a constant pace, and even though we hit obstacles, I never felt the
stress I have on previous projects. I think we can attribute this to effective
planning, organization, and communication. By our first meeting with our real world
project manager, we had all of our base expectations met. We were then able to
focus on UX, and extensions. Though a simple project to look at, it felt quite
rewarding to build (also my first attempt at significant JS)!

###ApiCurious
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Egogre/LitHub)
* [Original Assignment](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/traffic_spy.html)

Assessed By: Josh Mejia

Notes:

Scores:
* Features: 2
* Interface: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 4
* Server-Side Application and APIs: 3

Personal note: While Josh was using the wrong rubric for most of us and so didn't
evaluate our use of project organization, I feel I would have scored strongly here.
I had a robust tracking system on Waffle.io where I broke down chores, stories,
and enhancements that were updated in real time. I dove down some deep rabbit holes
on this project, leading me to not finish the requirements, yet having a better
understanding of OOP and the stateless nature of HTTP especially. I chose to not
have any database whatsoever for this project to see if I could make it viable
without one. All the features worked as I expected and I would have been able to
finish the objectives without a database without complications with just a bit more
time. It was a challenge to persist the data I wanted without use of a database.

###RailsEngine

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1507/11-rails_engine.markdown)

Assessed By: Jorge Tellez

Notes:

Scores:
* Completion: 4
* Test-Driven Development: 4
* Code Quality: 3.5
* API Design: 4
* Queries: 4:

Personal note: This project kicked my ass. So have all the Sales Engines and their
iterations! While I did much better score wise and ApiCurious, I am not as proud of
it. This project really let me feel how slow I am compared to many of my classmates.
I did not have my features complete until 5am the day it was due. This was not due
to slacking off earlier. I set midnight bedtimes for myself on the other nights. I
stayed up all night the last night because I wanted better scores than Api Curious.
There were many times where I felt like giving up. I still don't understand all
of what I implemented.

###Attendance
No absences. On time. EVERY time.

###Just For Fun

####Blackheart
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Egogre/blackheart)

This is a project I hope to implement over my time at Turing. It has been something I keep *intending* to make, but never dedicate enough time to. I use different branches to explore topics we cover in class as well as my own personal online/mentor inquiries. If I like those branches, I merge them into master. It is not graded. I use it just for a fun way to continue practicing my Rails. I restarted this from scratch recently
to see how long it would take me to build up to the point I had got to and was almost
disappointed with how little it felt like I had accomplished before!


Team
--------------------------------------
###Projects
I worked on just one team project this block:

####The Pivot
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ChrisCenatie/the_pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/traffic_spy.html)

Assessed by: Josh Mejia

Assessment notes:

* 155 tests with Great test coverage. Only 1 line not tested and it was a call to Twilio.
* Nice use of POROs.
* Controllers were really clean
* Twilio integration
* Some nice use of jQuery

Scores:

* Completion: 3
* Organization: 3
* Progress: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 4
* Code Quality: 3
* User Experience: 3

personal note: I helped David understand some basic DevOps stuff for the project.
I felt best about refactoring the tests so that as our code base grew, we only
needed to change a few lines in our tests instead of multiple tests. It made it
*much* easier to keep up with our testing during the project! Much of my time
was spent pairing with David and helping him understand each part we worked on.   


Feedback to Me
--------------------------------------
MB had some nice things to say about me. She states that I do a better job of
explaining my thought processes than before, which is nice to hear, as we delved
into complex problems in JavaScript and jQuery.

I continue to hear positive things from parents of my Kids Who Code. I was invited
to teach a technology class by a school principal (and will probably do this when
I am graduated and am available during the school day)


Community
-------------------------------------

###Giving Feedback

I usually take more time on the feedback forms than is allotted because I try to put
forth real feedback. This is mostly due to me feeling like Turing actually puts
this solicited feedback to use. I have filled out each form asked of me that I am
aware of.  

###Playing a Part

* http://turingwithgeorge.tumblr.com is still ongoing. I notice that my posts are
  becoming increasingly technical. I still have fun with it though and have many
  blog posts planned for the break! I feel my blog is a useful tool for myself as
  it forces me to go back through my notes and further research topics I am unclear
  on so that I can write about it more effectively.
* I led classes on Swift2 in order to learn more about it myself. I was pleased
  with the turnout the first week and had a lot of positive feedback from my peers
  about it, but by week 3 it was only me and Jason Pilz. And then just myself the
  following week. I am impressed with the thought behind the language. It is
  intuitive and easy to start using. I am thinking about using Swift as the
  language of choice for the next iteration of Kids Who Code so the kids can program
  real apps for use on real iOS systems.
* Kids Who Code is still going strong. Thank you Turing for supporting it! We are
  planning on giving a demonstration of the kids' projects on the same night as we
  demo our game time apps. Can I get meetup.com privileges so I can keep posting
  the events?
* I voluntarily gave 2 extra lightning talks, though one of them was only a pitch
  to take my Swift class! Though I feel my Crucial Conversations talk was less
  organized, I enjoyed sharing something that meant a great deal to me. 

## Notes

A: End-of-Module Assessment: 4
B: Individual Work & Projects: 4 
C: Group Work & Projects: 3
D: Community Participation: 4+ 
E: Peer & Instructor Feedback: 3

Pick one thing to do and commit to it rather than doing four things.  

Consider writing code for the next person.
