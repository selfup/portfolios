George Hudson - M4 Portfolio
============================


Individual
----------------------------
###Areas of Emphasis
My dad has been in the hospital for much of this module. His wife is making it
almost impossible for any family to visit him. My daughter came forward with
reports of sexual abuse that happened at after school care. I am having
flashbacks of years ago when my other daughter suffered even worse. Some might
use these as reasons to take a break this module. Instead, it has reaffirmed my
reasons for being here. I am building myself into a position where I can have greater
effect with the help I provide. I am strengthening myself in order to better combat
the obstacles of life.

With all that is going on, I am stretched quite thin. I feel stressed and ragged,
and messed up my last project by not spending enough time on it.

Now... the good stuff. My determination was tested, but man, I feel good about my
accomplishments here. Besides the Real Time application, I rocked my projects. I
lost track of how many high-fives, fist-bumps, etc. Holzman and I shared while
making chess. Kids Who Code finished up the first iteration strong, sharing their
awesome apps with students here. Next iteration starts Saturday January 30th! We
will be taking their development skills to the mobile platform! I am starting to
hear back from companies and feel like a strong candidate. Most of all, I enjoy
the creative and problem solving aspects of programming. Instead of feeling like
I was stagnating at my military and blue-collar jobs, I feel like I am challenged
and growing.

Thank you.

148/150 points (no extensions attempted)

Personal note: I finished this before midnight before the day it was due!

###Thoughtbox
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Egogre/thought_box)

Assessed By: Lovisa

90/100 points

Personal note: This project reminded me that I am slower at coding than most of
my peers. In order to continually put out strong scores, I have invested much more
time into each of my projects.

###RealTime
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Egogre/schedule_me)

Assessed By: Steve

83/200 points

Personal note: With all that was going on, I did not give myself enough time to
succeed at this project.

###Homework
100%

###Final
80/125 points. Was strong in all areas besides completion. My slower work pace
really hinders me in such time crunches.

###Attendance
I skipped coming in two days that were made into all day work days on solo projects.

One tardy. Story time: Forgot my computer and didn't find out till I was on the train.
Went home to get it and lost my wallet on the way to the back up bus stop. I ran
back along the path and luckily found it. Ran back to the bus stop. Made the back
up bus. Ran from the terminal to Turing... in fancy shoes not built for running...
made my achilles bloody. 15 minutes late. It was a bad start to a great day.

###Feedback to me
* Justin Holzman: George is pleasant to work with… and I’m reasonably sure he
  actually sees the entire world in X/Y coordinates.

  Working on Chess Trainer with him was the highlight of this module for me.

  He was quick to understand what we were trying to do. Was never arrogant about ideas.

  The biggest idea for improvement: Focus on practicing your hard skills (typing, hotkeys, workflow, etc). You already have an exceptionally good base to try things but being able to work faster will pay dividends down the road.

* Regis Boudinot: You are always letting people know that they are doing a good
  job. You are  like the “Dad” of our cohort! You are so busy with your family
  and teaching “Kids Who Code” that I find it difficult to understand how you
  even made it through this!!

  You did seem to be really really quiet during Mods 1 and 2. Mod 3 you started
  to open up to our cohort and now you are always being attentive.

  Keep doing you George. You seem to really enjoy this stuff!

* Jack Yeh: George is doing a really great thing teaching kids to code. It’s
  something that is personally important to me and I am glad that this projects is
  one that George is continuing post-Turing. George’s quiet demeanor and work ethic
  is a model or the rest of us. He just likes to get shit done. I look forward to
  helping George with Kids Who Code going into the future. Since, I didn’t work on
  a project or assignment with him, I don’t have suggestions for things he can
  improve on.

* George always had a smile. It was really cool to see him and Justin build out
  chess for Game Time. We all knew it was a hell of a project to take on for the
  short amount of time they had, and they never seemed overwhelmed or in poor
  spirit. George ‘High Five’ Hudson.

* Myself: I am not good at giving negative feedback. Ryan Asensio asked for one
  negative word feedback and I could not think of a single bad thing to say about
  him. I then made it a mission to think of constructive and kind negative feedback
  to others and feel I was mostly successful writing feedback for Erik.


Team
--------------------------------------
###Projects
I worked on just one team project this block:

###Chess
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jphoenix86/chess_trainer)

Assessed By: Lovisa

Notes: Wow

325/300 points

Personal note: We knew it was going to be a challenge when Steve advised against
building such a challenging game, "Just the logic behind Checkmate alone...", but
we set ambitious, yet overall attainable goals at each checkpoint and worked many
long, but rewarding hours to have a clean, complete chess game.


Community

###Giving Feedback

I usually take more time on the feedback forms than is allotted because I try to put
forth real feedback. This is mostly due to me feeling like Turing actually puts
this solicited feedback to use. I have filled out each form asked of me that I am
aware of.

###Playing a Part

* http://turingwithgeorge.tumblr.com is still ongoing. I notice that my posts are
  becoming increasingly technical. I still have fun with it though and have many
  blog posts planned for the break! I feel my blog is a useful tool for myself as
  it forces me to go back through my notes and further research topics I am unclear
  on so that I can write about it more effectively. Over 100 posts! I have many
  more to make as I am a module behind where my notes are at at this point. It
  will be good review.

* Kids Who Code is still going strong. Demo night went great! This meetup will
  continue after I graduate. It is highly rewarding. The kids are enthusiastically
  learning STEM. Shirts incomming! Thank you!
