# Michael Merrill - M4 Portfolio

## Individual


### Your Mission

This module was all about JS. Javascript was one of the reason I chose to come to Turing and I wanted to learn from Steve. This was by far my favorite module. Real Time was the first project that I felt like I could play with code and try multiple approaches for each problem. There is still a lot of javascript that I would like to better understand but I feel like what I've learned over the pass few months has helped me tremendously as a developer.


### End of Module Assessment

I didn't have take the final assessment due to points. However, the final honestly seemed pretty easy. Thoughtbox was a lot of fun and I really enjoy working with the javascript side of things and I feel comfortable building an api in ruby.

### Attendance

My attendance was not great this module. It's not an excuse, however my life outside of Turing is a little hectic. I have coded more this module than any other and applied myself as much as I could. I'm proud of the things I was able to complete both in and outside of Turing.

### Homework

82% (190 out 229)

### Work

I really enjoyed all the projects assigned this module.

### IdeaBox

#### Links

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/michaelkm/ideabox2.0)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/revenge_of_idea_box.markdown)

#### Description

A CRUD app designed with a JavaScript front end communicating with a Rails API back end. No frameworks like Ember, React, etc. allowed.

#### My synopsis

I thought Ideabox was a great way to start off the module. I would have been behind if I hadn't studied js and jquery before hand. I had the opportunity to help a few other students with this project as well since I finished early.

#### Assessment Scores:

94% (142 out of 150)

### Thoughtbox

#### Links

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/michaelkm/thoughtbox)
* [Original Assessment](https://gist.github.com/stevekinney/82831c5b25029415ce8b)

#### Description

Simulate module 4 all-day assessment by building a CRUD app with basic authentication and a client-side AJAX piece.

#### My synopsis

I think the addition of a simulated final is a great idea. I might not do the same thing as idea box though. I spend a lot of time looking at old code which made the project easier.

#### Assessment Scores:

 80% (80 out of 100)

#### Real Time (crowdsource)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/michaelkm/crowdsource)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/real_time.markdown)

In this project, we're going to head off the beaten track for a bit and build real time applications with WebSockets. When the server gets new information, it pushes it out to all of the connected clients.

#### My synopsis

By far my favorite project. I wish I had the opportunity to use a front end framework but this definitely showed my comfortability for jQuery and sockets.

#### Assessment Scores:

71% (142 out of 200) *I think I deserved a better score.*

## Team

### Projects

#### Game Time

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/plato721/lights-out)
* [Production](http://plato721.github.io/lights-out/)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)

Build a game that is playable in the browser. There is no server-side component for this project. You'll be using client-side JavaScript exclusively to complete this project.

#### My synopsis

Our game didn't use canvas which is a bummer because I wanted to get to learn it, however, pairing with Matt helped me get more comfortable with javascript and jQuery. I also learned a lot about css on this project as I built the flickering neon lights for the title. That was really fun.

#### Assessment Scores:

### Feedback to me

> Michael has always provided great information to me when I needed it. I remember in my first module he talked to me about how important and difficult TDD is and now fast-forwarding to Module 3 He’s helping me debug my AJAX issue. Michael is not only knowledgable but he is relatable. He can explain and teach difficult concepts to lay people like me (it was my first real interaction with JS and AJAX). He’ll be a super great developer for any team he’s on!

>  Mike got along well with us 1507ers, especially for coming in only at the end. He was enthusiastic about his work. When he made some really cool styling for his lights out app, he shared his code and explained it well. Michael could have spent more time with us and share more of his great ideas and styling wisdom.

### Feedback from me

> Matt Ewell, what can we say about this man that hasn't already been said about men like Churchill, Eisenhower, and Bruce Wayne? He's the kind of man that video game lead characters are made of, always there ready and willing to take on the boss. Some say Matt has Jedi like powers. Others say that when he skis, the mountain moves for him. Im not sure if any of that is true, but I did code with him once and he knows his shit. He was never hungry because he just ate all the code all the time. Also, our project is pretty sweet so I think that speaks for itself.

> George always had a smile. It was really cool to see him and Justin build out chess for Game Time. We all knew it was a hell of a project to take on for the short amount of time they had, and they never seemed overwhelmed or in poor spirit. George ‘High Five’ Hudson.

> Jhun came to me for some JS help working on the Trello project. We debugged the problem for a bit and he was excellent at walking through the code and showing the root of the problem. Not afraid to ask for help when he needs it, and confidence to tackle problems on this own; Jhun will be a great developer. Keep it up man!

### Being a Community Member

* I helped other teams debug and refactor their javascript this module. Specifically, I helped Jhun's team with the Trello project quite a bit.
* I gave a talk about how to hack a job interview in hopes that it would help other students get the job they want.

### Playing a Part

* I encouraged people that javascript doesn't suck and that this stuff isn't that hard, it just takes time.
* I talked my 1511 buddy out of turing-depression and supported him for the rest of the module.
* Honestly, I just support other people here. People come to me when they are freaking out, and I'm ok with that.
