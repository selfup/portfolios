## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

I entered this module with a strong finish to the previous one. My goal was to get a thorough grasp of the taught concepts, as well as explore some other technical interests. Overall, I accomplished the first goal, but slid a little on the second. Due to the group projects, I did not have much time to spare for the majority of the module. I did, however, improve my group working and leadership skills. By working in two groups of 4, it challenged me to become a better communicator and stronger leader.

### End of Module Assessment

My progress through the module was assessed by Tess and the results follow:

Took the scorekeeper challenge

Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking: 4
Ruby Syntax & Standard Library: 3
Rails Syntax & API: 4
Rails Style: 4
Testing: 3
Collaboration 3

### Projects

There were no individual projects this module

Following are the two group projects completed this module.

#### Traffic Spy 

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/roseak/traffic_spy)
* [Original Assignment](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/traffic_spy.html)

  This project was challenging because of the concetps, as well as the group dynamic(intially).We implemented a site traffic tracker and analysis tool. 

Functional Expectations: 3
Test-Driven Development: 4
Encapsulation / Components: 3
Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
Sinatra / Web and Business Logic: 3

##### My Contribution

  My contribution to this project was mainly as a guide for the team. We paired through the entire project, and my pair and I implemented the logic behind the url-specific data. This consited mainly of SQLite querires using the Sequel gem.


##### Takeaway
* Group dynamics can make or break a team 
*  I problem-solve best on my own 
*  Mob coding can be very frustrating 
#### Little Shop of Orders (FasterFood)

  * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rasensio1/faster_food)
  * [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown)

  This project was a lot of fun. Our group of four was tasked to build an e-commerce site, where a user can add items to a cart and check out. There is also additional Admin functionality, use of 3 different APIs and front-end that isn't too bad. This project was fun, because the technical challenges weren't demoralizing, and yet, we put in a lot of good work.

 Views need to be cleaned up. Grading rubric for views factors in partials and helpers, but there were script tags that didn't need to be there.
 Excellent effort to move logic down the stack. Created a few POROS

Feature Completeness: 4
Views: 4
Controllers: 4
Models: 4
Testing: 4
Usability: 3
Workflow: 3
##### My Contribution

I was the team lead for this project. I set a very general scope and path for us to take in impementing the project. Code-wise, I implemented CRUD functionality for multiple models, the cart, added ActiveRecord Relationships, set up correct routing paths, added front-end design using boostrap templates and custom css, and implemented an API to calculate item delivery time. Additionally, I was the "unsticker" of the group --helping people get past walls and pulling the group out of the weeds, when we were deep in a problem.

##### Takeaway

  * Stamina is important
  * A good leader facilitates others' progress
  * Deployment can be mysterious 


## Community
### Giving Feedback

  I did my best to give insightful feedback to my peers, highlighting both what they do best and what they can improve on. I make a strong effort to err on the harsher side while providing criticism so that people who want to change for the better have material to work off of.

### Playing a Part

  I emptied and refilled ~5 dishwashers this module. Not too bad, but not as good as last module. I helpled out a 1508 student on several occasions in the first few weeks. 
I addented DSA a few times. I brought breakfast the second-to-last friday for the school. I gave a pretty cool lightning talk about cheese.
 Will do another in the same style next module.  Also helped lead a student session with Jusin Holzmann.
 
 ## Outcomes
 
 ## A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations.

* 4: Student achieved two or more "4s" on the assessment

## B: Individual Work & Projects

A Turing student works to maximize their skill growth and demonstrates
that skill across a variety of work.

* 4: Student demonstrates excellent growth by not only achieving satisfactory
evaluations for each project but also pushing their learning beyond expectations.

## C: Group Work & Projects

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, and delivers a high-quality product.

* 3: Student fully participates in their group work to facilitate group harmony
while achieving consistently satisfactory results.

## D: Community Participation

A Turing student builds up the community around them by participating and
supporting other students, the larger Turing family, and persons outside our
walls who want to develop their own skills.


* 3: Student participates in required activities and does at least one or two
above-and-beyond supports of the community.

## E: Peer & Instructor Feedback

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.

* 3: Student consistently delivers meaningful feedback for peers and implements
strategies to improve themselves in response to feedback.
