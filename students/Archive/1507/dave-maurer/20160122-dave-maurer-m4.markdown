# Dave Maurer - M4 Portfolio

### Areas of Emphasis

Testing is getting better, now I'm at a point where I feel I need to be able to crack anything open and look inside of it, so
emphasis was on pry and learning how to use the dev tools in the browser(especially for javascript). I also learned that console.log
is your best friend, until you have 10 of them going and can't figure out which one is the piece of data you want to examine at the time.
Other than that I tried to absorb as much as possible from the lessons, which were excellent this module by the way. I never felt like
any of the lessons were just kind of afterthoughts, and I couldn't in good faith say that the last time around.

### End of Module Assessment

67 points 
Feedback I was given: Testing was the best she had seen with 32 tests, all controllers, models, and features covered. Code quality was well above 
most other submissions and git workflow was granular and well organized. Meeka's overall impression was that this was a quality final assessment that
ia worthy of a Turing Grad. This comment especially had an impact, as I've always wanted to not just meet the score, but reach the level of expectation.

### Projects

Group Projects:

#### GameTime

This project focused on object oriented javascript with open ended options for rendering. We chose to use a canvas.
Erik and I both agreed to try a different style of game this time, to stretch our abilities a little. A requestAnimationFrame
style game proved to be similar in many ways, but just different enough that there was still some hair pulling going on in the
wee hours of the night.

####RealTime

My first actual crack at this one, as I was in San Antonio for 7 of the 9 days last time. I like websocket and what they can
accomplish, but need more practice to become comfortable with the send/emit/socket.on cycle that's going on there.

### Feedback to me

I'm pretty sure a lot of people have good things to say behind my back, and I'm also pretty sure not everyone would. I feel like
this feedback thing is a little unrefined as is, and would like to see something else done with it. Like...we outline what we think
others would say, or how we think they feel about us, or just how we think we portray ourselves, then we get actual feedback from anonymous
peers that the staff has collected over the module. I feel like that would be a more effective behavioral learning tool. That's assuming the
goal of this section is to encourage self-reflection and realistic self view of course. With that said...

Feedback from people:
Travis Haby: Dave is a great learner. He has constant positivity and a strong work ethic. Even when some concepts don’t come
immediately to him, he puts in the hard work and leverages the malleable intelligence mindset to continuously grow and overcome
challenges. I think sometimes in the context of a project he could put more of an emphasis on TDDing parts of his code first
that might drive him to come to a solution  quicker in the long run or be able to more effectively breakdown a complex problem.

Bret Doucette: Out of all the people at Turing, Dave is the most inspiring person here. His work ethic, dedication, and diligence
are inspiring.  I really enjoyed having him as an addition to our cohort. I hope to have his work ethic and dedication going forward.
I remember how at the Christmas Party he told me how he does each warmup over and over again day in and day out. This is but one of
the many examples of his work ethic. DAVE is awesome!

Erik Butcher: Dave has an insuppressible energy and doesn’t let setbacks get him down; he knows how to celebrate small victories and not
take it overboard. He can be a rock for support no matter what difficulty you face.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

I love giving feedback, but this module I haven't done a good job of filling out the surveys. One on ones however, I go overboard on,
and usually need to be stopped by the person I'm meeting with so we don't go over time. I'm also not shy about sharing my opinions personally
with staff and students when I think something needs to be said, or can be tweaked. On that front I think I've always carried my weight, and
hope that some of my ramblings have resulted in positive action.

Feedback to People:
Travis Haby: Travis has a great initial understanding of new concepts, and is good at conveying that understanding to others.
In Kay posse, he almost always takes the lead when doing warm up, and is able to help other members with project questions, even if he
hasn't worked on the project before. He helped me through linked lists using TDD, and I still refer back to that to this day to reinforce
the approach. If I were Turing, I would put a bug in his ear about sticking around maybe...

Bret Doucette: Bret’s understanding of MVC principles and his ability to quickly learn new technologies is a source of inspiration for me.
An example of this is his adoption of Zombie for testing his websockets app. He was able to implement it, try it out, then trash it and
switch to a totally different system all in a couple of days. I admire Bret’s dedication and work ethic, as evidenced by his git commits
and the late hours I see him put in regularly. I would not hesitate to have him on any team I am a part of.

Erik Butcher: Erik’s understanding of how code works is remarkable. At any time during our Game Time project, I knew I could go to him for
help working through difficult parts of the logic. He was responsible for getting the tomatoes to go in random directions, which was giving
me trouble when I tried to implement that feature. When crunch time comes, and something needs to get done, Erik is able to rise to the challenge.

Aaron Greenspan: Aaron has an unquenchable desire to learn about and study computers and related concepts. His initiative in leading morning
sessions on machine learning and AI is admirable, and his zeal is infectious. When around him I can’t help but feel more inquisitive and excited
about code. Aaron could improve by slowing down sometimes and delving more deeply into certain concepts. He is learning an incredible amount
about a lot of things, but eventually I believe he will gravitate toward mastery of a few.

Tori Joy-Warren: Tori is very enthusiastic about life in general, and it rubs off in a very positive way with the posse. She regularly corrals
the group for outings and encourages participation during warm ups. She also enjoys learning new concepts, such as elixir. She spearheaded an
elixir warmup which was very informative. To improve, Tori should have more faith in her abilities as a programmer and take the initiative to
teach others and take charge of warmups more often. She has the chops for it.

### Playing a Part

My niche is still the Posse, but I also really like improv, and have been attending regularly. Jessica is awesome, and it really is a great
tool for getting people to be sensitive to others, and slowly begin to be able to read others, and maybe even adjust their own behavior according
to the feedback they get from others. Isn't that half of an interview anyway?

(this next part is left in from my last portfolio review, because it still applies. I always try to give positive energy to others. In fact,
I thrive off of it. Maybe I should become a life coach. Hmmmmmm.)
Apart from the Posse, I always try to spread positivity and help others keep perspective about projects, deadlines, and
life in general. I encourage those who want to teach things, and am sure to compliment those who attempt things that stretch
them out of their comfort zones, or make an impact. Just a few compliments here and there can be the difference between
feeling appreciated and continuing, or feeling like it's not worth it and stopping. I like to help push people toward the
former outcome whenever I can, and actively seek opportunities to do so.

## Review

(this still applies also, with the added comment that Turing really is a crucible of sorts. It burns out the weakness and uncertainty
 in students, and leaves behind a stronger person, both from the developer standpoint, and on a personal level. Wherever my life takes
 me after this, I will carry with me the belief and I can do anything, and that right there, the self confidence derived from a journey
 like this one, is worth more than all the knowledge and the employability I've gained. So thanks.)

Turing has been a life changing experience for me. Because Turing exists, I was able to see a path to the world of programming.
A path that would not have been possible to envision otherwise. Because of the passion and commitment at Turing, both on the
staff side and the student body side, I was able to progress through a learning curve that would have stopped me cold at week
one in a normal academic environment.

I am very grateful for all of the time and effort that went in to my time here, and I feel lucky that events unfolded in such
a way that Turing became a thing I was aware of, and then a thing that I'm a part of. Whatever I'm doing 20 years from now
Turing will have a lasting impact on the way I think, learn, and interact with others.

Specific to Module 4, I've learned even more javascript this time around, to the point where I would enjoy being a javascript
developer. It's a fun language, and I actually enjoy the quirks that come along with it. Like anything worth spending time on, it
has character. There is still a lot for me to learn, and I'm not even close to having a firm understanding of even the fundamentals,
but Steve has made sure I know enough to be dangerous, and that means I know enough to get hired.
