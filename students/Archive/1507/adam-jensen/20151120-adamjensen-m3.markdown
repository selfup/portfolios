Adam Jensen - M3


## Individual

### Your Mission

I was well aware that M3 is the module that students learn about API's. I've always liked API's. I worked customer service and helped people troubleshoot and I always thought it would be amazing to be the developer that was the one using the API's.

In short, the biggest goal of this module was to go beyond CRUD apps. The value is of twitter is not CRUD'ing "Tweets", its users that use the service and the data flowing between the users.

My goal was to learn about API's and how to build bigger and better apps. Really, I thought that this would be something that I would shine at.

# MB Burch

Adam is an awesome partner. He is 100% all-in and dedicated when working on a project. I always felt like he was totally present and willing to work. I enjoy pairing with him because he is patient and receptive to ideas other than his own. He was also willing and excited to show me new ways of doing things (Materialize, building a search bar, using JS,etc.). I think both of us could have benefitted from being more assertive and offering honest feedback to our team throughout the process of this project. I think we got a little frustrated with things that could have been solved had we addressed group dynamics a little earlier in the process. I’d be psyched to work with Adam again on any project!



# mimi.schatz

Good: I felt totally confident that you would get all of your work completed on time. You’ve made a great network a mentors and I think it’s made you a stronger programmer. I also relied heavily on you for all of my front end problems. So great to have that opportunity to learn from you! Bad: In light of reading your note to me, I think what you said was very true. I think as a leader you know what you would like to do, but seem nervous telling people what to do . I think that’s why I started to be more vocal. It didn’t feel like we were progressing, but that was unfair to you as the person in charge. Don’t be nervous!! You know what you’re doing, so feel free to tell me, and others, what to do. Conclusion: I would definitely work with Adam again!
