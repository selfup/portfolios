# Adam Jensen - M2/ Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis
(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)
After completing M1, I was well aware that I was not the strongest student in
the 1507 cohort. I am somewehat bothered by this and I spent the entire
intermission week studying. I was especially happy that the material introduced 
was *NEW* and exciting!

I was very determined to do well in this module. I figured that I might not be
the strongest rubyist, but I could work really hard on Rails and do well. After all,
no one really had experience with Rails!

So, in short, my biggest area of emphasis was to learn Rails. I wanted to incredible at Rails!

### End of Module Assessment

# Adam Jensen module 2 final assessment

Assessed by: Josh Mejia on 2015.09.29

Challenge:

```
1. Top Plays

Similar to the test_it_displays_only_three_previous_plays, write tests and functionality to implement a list of top scoring plays.

Display the top scoring plays, up to five, ordered highest to lowest
If two or more words have the same score, they should rank the same. So you might have 1, 2, 2, 4, 5.
```

## Scores

### 1. Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking

Score: 4

```
4: Developer independently breaks complex processes into logical sequences of small steps and validates progress along the way
```

### 2. Ruby Syntax & Standard Library

Score: 3

```
3: Developer is able to comfortably implement solutions in Ruby
```

### 3. Rails Syntax & API

Score: 3+

```

3: Developer is able to utilize Rails methods and structures, but needs some direct guidance

```

### 4. Rails Style

Score: 3+

```

3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack
```

### 5. Testing

Score: 3+

```
3: Developer uses tests at multiple layers of abstraction to drive development
```

### 6. Collaboration

Score: 4

```
4: Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck
```


### Attendance

I did not have an absence during Module 2.

## Team FeedBack

#### From Travis Haby

Adam definitely seemed to struggle with continuing to stay positive and engaged after he didn't understand something. It seemed like he was totally capable of grasping a concept with a little more persistence but sometimes he would start to shut down and disengage from grappling with a difficult concept (active record relations, etc.), which made it harder to understand what was going on. When we were mob coding I or Matt would explain something to him when he asked a question, and would sometimes day everything was ok and he understood even when it seemed like he didn't. I pushed back a few times and asked things like "are you sure you're good with that?" or "should we go over that one more time?" but unfortunately he would sometimes choose to not take that opportunity and allow our group to move on without him, which ended up snowballing into a larger and larger problem. I felt like I tried pretty hard to help him out and bring him along but it was really challenging to push past difficulties in his understanding when he became disengaged.

#### From Matt Hecker

Prior to our project together I had no idea how hard of a worker Adam was. Halfway through the project Adam fell behind. He felt he didn’t understand what was going on in our code base. After that, there was never a point Adam wasn’t striving to to increase his understanding. Between constantly seeking the support of mentors and ourselves Adam was able to catch up and even completely implement an extension on the project all by himself.  I was floored by the amount of momentum he gained by staying late and working things out.

Besides being a hard worker he also showed alot of patience. Often the exchanges on how to proceed with the project would leave him out of the conversation due to him being polite and slightly quiet. Despite being cut off mid sentence he maintained composure and made sure that we understood him.

* [Original Assignment](not yet available)

A great project! Loved the flexibilty to branch out and try new technologies, integrations,
and tasks. For me, this project was a good confidence booster and I finally started
to feel like I might actually be learning Rails!

I feel like this project was the first actual project with complex team dynamics,
work-flow, tasks, and expectations.

#### Feedback From George Hudson

Great enthusiasm. I was happy to see you tackle projects you were not sure about and then return with something workable.  You were good at communication and at getting me to communicate better (one of my weaknesses in my opinion). You were patient, I think today was the only time we were even the slightest bit snappish and it was only because we were describing the same thing differently. … things to do better. Hmmm. this is always the harder one. usually because I don’t want to hurt feelings  but this time because I was really happy with you as a team member. We set a strong pace at the beginning and then I didn’t feel too rushed at the end. You helped us maintain that momentum. You answered my questions (especially my css questions) well. I feel MUCH stronger at css and html now.  Your weaknesses are mostly in that you just need to keep learning programming and you are already doing that.

#### Feedback From Jerrod Junker

You’re usually very open to trying things that you haven’t before and learn them in depth(like paperclip).  Something you could improve on: Seeking to pair with people more than you already do could be beneficial

#### Feedback from Matt Ewell

None as of yet.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

I provided feedback to all persons that directly asked for it as well as all
official partners during M2 projects.

### Playing a Part

I certainly tried to help out around the Turing Basement ALOT more. Specifically,
I found helping students and reaching out to new people quite rewarding. I really
didn't mind spending a couple of hours with some of the new 1508 students and helping
them with projects and talking them through the initial pressure that is common
when in M1.

I also tried to contribute a lot more feedback for the Student Advisory Board. This
meant actively seeking feedback. This is more diffucult than I originally thought.
Most students do not have any feedback when approached directly. However, when
feedback was offered, I was happy to share it with SAB.

I also contributed my lightning talk during week 5 of M2 on basic algorithms.

## Review

### Notes

( Leave blanks for reviewers )

### Outcome

## A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations.

* 4: Student achieved two or more "4s" on the assessment

## B: Individual Work & Projects

A Turing student works to maximize their skill growth and demonstrates
that skill across a variety of work.

* 3: Student demonstrates commitment and growth in their work through satisfactory
evaluations of each project or a clearly upward-sloping trend.

## C: Group Work & Projects

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, and delivers a high-quality product.

* 3: Student fully participates in their group work to facilitate group harmony
while achieving consistently satisfactory results.

## D: Community Participation

A Turing student builds up the community around them by participating and
supporting other students, the larger Turing family, and persons outside our
walls who want to develop their own skills.

* 3: Student participates in required activities and does at least one or two
above-and-beyond supports of the community.

## E: Peer & Instructor Feedback

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.

* 3: Student consistently delivers meaningful feedback for peers and implements
strategies to improve themselves in response to feedback.
