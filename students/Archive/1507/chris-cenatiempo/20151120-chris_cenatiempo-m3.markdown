# Chris Cenatiempo - M3 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

Prior to the module my goal was to dive into how to work with APIs and gain more technical knowledge of rails. In addition to my goal of attaining more technical knowledge, I've continued try to discover the areas of programming where I excel. Throughout this module I've learned that I enjoy pairing projects much more than solo projects. For the future I plan on doing much more pair work and will be looking for employment with a company that has an emphasis on pairing.

### Feedback Given to Me

#### Self Directed Project
This project was great, I’m really glad that we were on the same page that we wanted to push ourselves and learn a new framework instead of going the easy route and building this in Rails. I really appreciated your work ethic, I think I woke up to a late night pull request at least a couple of times throughout this project. For as much as you seem to dislike front end, we just built an entire project that was entirely front end, and you kicked butt at it. I think we work well together, we both work slowly and methodically, so I think that worked well. As frustrating as it was to learn Angular, I think this project was a great experience, and I’m really glad we were working together on it!

### Playing a Part In the Community

* On Tuesday, Oct 13, I attended Denver.rb meetup to hear Marla's lighting talk about Ruby Tooling
* On Friday, Oct 26, I gave a student led session on Matlab (https://gist.github.com/ChrisCenatie/85e24bdfab2051ae133a)
* On Wednesday, Nov 18, I attended the DeRailed Developer meetup (http://www.meetup.com/DeRailed/)


## Goals Moving Forward

In addition to learning and applying new skills, I plan on taking part community events going forward, including:

* Giving Lightning Talks
* Updating my personal website and resume
* Attending Developer Meet-ups

## Outcome

* A: End-of-Module Assessment: 4
* B: Individual Work & Projects: 3
* C: Group Work & Projects: 3
* D: Community Participation: 3
* E: Peer & Instructor Feedback: 3
