### Areas of Emphasis

Prior to the module my goal was to dive deeper into how to work through both the front-end and the back-end. In addition to my goal of attaining more technical knowledge, I've wanted to try to discover the areas of programming where I excel. Understanding where I best fit in will not only help me with contributing to group projects, but also help me understand the best position for me.

### End of Module Assessment
Testing was generally good
Had some problems with Rails helpers (specifically. But MVC knowledge was good)

1. Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking
3: Developer breaks complex problems into small, digestible steps and executes them

2. Ruby Syntax & Standard Library
3: Developer is able to comfortably implement solutions in Ruby

3. Rails Syntax & API
3: Developer is able to utilize Rails methods and structures, but needs some direct guidance

4. Rails Style
3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack

5. Testing
3: Developer uses tests at multiple layers of abstraction to drive development

6. Collaboration
3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process


### Attendance

This module I attended all days and classes

## Team

### Projects

I participated in the following team projects:

#### TrafficSpy
* [GitHub URL] (https://github.com/mbburch/traffic-spy)
* [Original Assignment] (http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/traffic_spy.html)

In this project we created a sinatra app to build a web app for web tracking and analysis. I wrote code for a lot of the back-end and the back-end code for the extension of registering and viewing campaigns.

      notes:
        * Good pulling out of things into partials
        * Methods in controller were a little heavy and could stand to be refactored
        * Good use of helper classes, would like to have seen more
        * More logic could be pushed to the models
        * design was pleasant
        * JSon works, and campaigns work
        * 38 tests

### Feedback Given to Me
#### From Traffic-Spy
* Has awesome ideas! Great at admitting when something is wrong, but his ideas are always worth exploring. We all think he can be more assertive and make sure his ideas are tried and heard! Ask others to explain their thinking, not with the intention of proving them wrong, but to make sure everyone's ideas are considered.

#### From Little Shop
* You seem to be a very hard worker. It was fun to be the leader of the project because I could just tell you to do things and you'd have them done, sometimes at 2am. I remember you saying at the end of last module that you didn't expect to enjoy this module, so you won't be surprised that I don't think this kind of work pushed you to your potential. It might benefit you to try being a team leader on the next project. You were an asset to the team.

* You were great to work with. You're very strong with Ruby, I like your refactoring instincts, and you're also strong with Rails (whether you like it or not). I really appreciated all the work you put in after hours, especially down the home stretch. The only criticism I can offer is sometimes you would have a problem with certain parts of the app, but it seemed like you weren't really able to communicate why you had a problem with it, so it kind of made it difficult to talk through what I was thinking when I wrote it. Overall, it was a great experience, though, and I certainly look forward to working with you again.

* I enjoyed working with you again. You really have a strong grasp of everything we’ve learned this module, and you come up with creative solutions. You are able to dig in and figure out why something isn’t working. You can be laser focused and in the zone with work, but also bring a fun sense of humor which is nice to lighten things up. I’d say the same thing as traffic spy…. try verbalizing your thought process more because I think it will help others to learn from you and help you to clarify your ideas. And give the front end a shot even though you hate it!

### Playing a Part In the Community

* On Friday, Sept 04, I organized an informal gathering for Turing Students and learned La Bamba for guitar
* I regularly attended most DSA events and completed binary-search trees
* On Wednesday, Sept 09, I attended the viewing of the Internet's Own Boy (documentary about Aaron Schwartz)
* On Friday, Sept 25, I volunteered to help moderate Lightning talks
* On Friday, Oct 02, I will be giving a Lightning Talk about the open source software Audacity


## Goals Moving Forward

In addition to learning and applying new skills, I plan on taking part community events going forward, including:

* Giving Lightning Talks
* Creating a (Good) personal website
* Helping Organize Community Events
* Attending Developer Meet-ups
* 

## Outcomes

## A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations.

* 3: Student achieved a "3" or better on each category of the assessment

## B: Individual Work & Projects

A Turing student works to maximize their skill growth and demonstrates
that skill across a variety of work.

* 3: Student demonstrates commitment and growth in their work through satisfactory
evaluations of each project or a clearly upward-sloping trend.

## C: Group Work & Projects

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, and delivers a high-quality product.

* 3: Student fully participates in their group work to facilitate group harmony
while achieving consistently satisfactory results.

## D: Community Participation

A Turing student builds up the community around them by participating and
supporting other students, the larger Turing family, and persons outside our
walls who want to develop their own skills.

* 3: Student participates in required activities and does at least one or two
above-and-beyond supports of the community.

## E: Peer & Instructor Feedback

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.


* 3: Student consistently delivers meaningful feedback for peers and implements
strategies to improve themselves in response to feedback.
