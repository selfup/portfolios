# Rick Bacci - M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis
I tried to change my workflow in the ways that were suggested. I honestly
think that this environment is not good for me to practice this. When I
implement this workflow I stay more focused, when I rush I get very
fragmented. I believe that as I make these ideas part of my regular routine
that I would gain in the long-run.


### End of Module Assessment

[task-list-175](https://github.com/RickBacci/task-list-assessment)
[Production - task-list-175](https://task-list-175.herokuapp.com/)
* 72% - 90 pts

This was a difficult project to complete in the time-frame alloted. I
really wish there was a better way to gauge someones progress.


### Work
I completed the following individual work this module:

#### Homework
* 89.96% - 206 pts


#### Ideabox
* 105.33% - 158pts

[GitHub URL](https://github.com/RickBacci/ideabox3)
[Production](https://ideabox3-175.herokuapp.com/)

I had alot of fun doing this project. It was the first thing that we became
familiar with, and all we had to do was think about coding.


#### Pacman
* 38.33% - 115 pts

[Pacman](https://github.com/RickBacci/pac-man)

I did this game by myself. I believe that I had a pretty solid understanding
of what I needed to do. I ended up making a poor design decision attempting
to use the structure of another game, and it ended up setting me back.

I had alot of functionality done, but ran out of time to refactor. I also
deviated from testing first, and this cost me as well.


#### ThoughtBox assessment
* 100% - 100pts

[GitHub URL](https://github.com/RickBacci/thoughtbox-assessment)

I was more comfortable doing this project than I was the last time in the
longer version in the last assessment.

#### TwoCentsWorth
* 47.5% - 95pts

[GitHub URL](https://github.com/RickBacci/TwoCentsWorth)
[Production - TwoCentsWorth](http://crowdsource-175.herokuapp.com/)

I was sick for a few days right in the middle of this project and I wasn't
able to catch back up. I did do a lot of planning and I feel that the app
had a solid design structure. The main functionality that I needed took
longer than I thought.

Josh Cheek suggested that I tag him and @jbrr, and @selfup in my PR's and
that I try to keep them to 2 hours. I did well with this on Friday & Saturday.
It was very grounding to have others commenting on my work.

At the end of the project I couldn't overcome the lost time, and ended up
getting stuck more than i would have liked.

## Team

### Projects

I was not a part of any team projects. My pair for game-time, wanted to create
a game that he had envisioned. He had no problem with me doing something else,
so I worked on Pacman.


## Community

I do my best to help anyone that asks.
This I something that I enjoy. Feels good to do it.
I did work weekly with 1 mentor(Viki). I also submitted some PR's to another
mentor who is on the east coast. I also shared PR's with @jbrr and @selfup
on the advice of Josh Cheek.

### Giving Feedback
Rick: We went through some real ups and downs together over the last year
at Turing, from some of our darkest moments to some of our most triumphant.
The one thing I was most impressed with over that time was that even when
you were struggling the hardest, you never wavered in your desire to keep
working or to keep getting better. You also never backed down from a challenge,
and even went out of your way to challenge yourself
(**cough cough** using vim **cough cough**).  Going forward, my only advice
would be to keep as open a mind as possible to othersâ€™ ideas or solutions.
We both have a very specific way of thinking about things and it is easy to
forget that there are other (and sometimes better) ways to approach a problem.
Gonna miss you man. I wish you the best of luck in all your future endeavors.


I've really enjoyed getting to know you, you're a great guy and you've always
got a really interesting perspective on things, both code and life in general.
We haven't had a chance to formally pair often, but from reviewing your code,
I think you've got great instincts, and you're incredibly sharp.
I really enjoyed the opportunity to review your pull requests over the course
of this last project, and you're right, I wish we had thought of it earlier.
You know this stuff better than I do, for sure. You're always willing to
help others, and that's a great quality to have. The thing I would say to
work on, which we've talked about before, is just your time management.
Just keep in your mind that if you're on a deadline, you need to get a
minimum viable product out, and work on refactoring and more features after
that. I think we could've gotten a lot out of working together, I wish we
had been able to do that at Turing, but maybe we'll have a chance to do
that in the future.


I left feedback for other members as well.

### Playing a Part

I try to pass on what I know to others. Helping others feels good especially
when I'm stuck on something. I also try to pass on any tips or tricks
that I have learned, and generally be available for others. Helping others
gives me a solid gauge on how well I understand what I have been taught.
