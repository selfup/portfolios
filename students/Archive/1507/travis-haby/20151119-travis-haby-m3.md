# Travis Haby - M3 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

This module I really tried to keep pushing myself to learn new things and take academic risks in my projects. It was rewarding to so something outside of the ordinary with my API-Curious project, as well as creating a real product for a real business need with SchoolRunner project C. After turning in API-Curious and Rails Engine this module, I finally started to feel like a real developer that could actually provide some value to a development team--I can sort of see why someone might want to hire me :)

### Attendance

I attended all days of class, arriving at school before 8:30 every day.

### Team Projects

I completed the following team projects:

#### The Pivot

  * repository: https://github.com/MikeJerrodTravis/the_pivot
  * group_discussion_notes: None

##### Notes:

* While the scores below seem to imply a weak project, the scores were a result of taking risks and challenging skill level. The team's skills are better as a result and this should be taken into account during portfolio reviews.
* Pushing boundries of comfort level with jQuery. Attempting things more complicated than the other projects I assessed.
* Styling could use more work.
* jQuery cart is a good start but the interface needs polish. Some prices are using dollars and others are using cents. Email sent is not complete.
* Good code quality and use of POROs

##### Scores:

* Completion: 2
* Organization: 4
* Progress: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 2
* Code Quality: 3
* User Experience: 2

### Feedback to Me

## Community

### Playing a Part

Especially these last two weeks I've supported some module 2 groups with solivng problems in their Little Shop projects. It been great to feel like I was able to actually help people when they were stuck with rails problems.

Still doing the dishes frequently. I've made more pots of coffee this module than a Columbian barista.
