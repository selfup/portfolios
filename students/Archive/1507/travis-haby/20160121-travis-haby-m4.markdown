# Travis Haby - M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission

Become a solid JavaScript developer and further cement best practices for code design and workflow in both JavaScript and Ruby. I put a lot of effort into refactoring
code to be more DRY and more readable.

### End of Module Assessment

N/A - Didn't have to take due to sufficient points accumulated during the module.

### Attendance

I attended all days of this module at Turing punctually.

### Work

#### Side Project

I built a [reatively simple data analysis app](http://urban-leaders-dashboard.herokuapp.com) for my girlfriend's work to practice serving
up an API with Rails and using the lodash library of JavaScript to manipulate data, along with some plug and play bar graphs from
highcharts.com to display an analysis of the applicants filtered by race, gender, and progress through the application process.

#### IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/travishaby/javascript_idea_box)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/revenge_of_idea_box.markdown)

###### Description

This project went pretty well, but was definitely a struggle in terms of trying to use only functional JavaScript to keep track of a bunch
moving parts. As I'm sure it was intended to do it made me REALLY appreciate OO javascript using prototype methods.

###### Notes

**Total:** 141/150 Points

#### RealTime

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/travishaby/javascript_idea_box)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/revenge_of_idea_box.markdown)

##### Description

RealTime was one of my favorite projects during all of Turing. I thought the technology of websockets was really cool, and it was also a
very enjoyable experience to create an (almost) full-stack application entirely in JavaScript. I did a lot of refactoring throughout the
project and focused on putting logic in the right places, as well as writing good OO JavaScript.

##### Notes

**Total:** 176/200 Points

###### Concept and Features

* 85/100 points - Met expectations as outlined by the user personas, the application is a solid first version. All planned features were delivered.

###### Code Quality (JavaScript and/or Ruby)

* 27/30 points - Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

###### Client-Side Application

* 25/30 points - Your application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs.

###### Test-Driven Development

* 30/30 points - The code demonstrates high test coverage. It is tested at the feature, controller and unit levels. It tests the WebSocket as well as the controller endpoints.

###### Interface

* 4/5 points - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

###### Workflow

* 5/5 points - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

### Projects

#### GameTime

This project was a clone of the 1942 game for the original nintendo. In Turing fashion, we put our instructors' heads on the game and
trolled Horace by having the "airplane" (Jorge's head) fire poop emojis.

### Feedback to me

###### From Matt Ewell:
Travis is key part of 1507. He took his job with SAB seriously enough to prod us for feedback, and I know he took action on this
feedback as well as I followed up on minutes from these meetings. He put together a very well organized service opportunity for us
at the school where he used to teach which was awesome.

###### From Jack Yeh:
Travis is key part of 1507. He took his job with SAB seriously enough to prod us for feedback, and I know he took action on this feedback
as well as I followed up on minutes from these meetings. He put together a very well organized service opportunity for us at the school
where he used to teach which was awesome. Travis was fearless in trying anything to get functionality working. Which was great because
he was not attached to any one approach or idea he just came up with. But it also meant that it was difficult to think 2 or 3 steps
ahead. He may want to consider spending a bit more time thinking about design and how to be intentional about it.

###### From Dave Maurer
Travis has a great initial understanding of new concepts, and is good at conveying that understanding to others. In Kay posse, he almost
always takes the lead when doing warm up, and is able to help other members with project questions, even if he hasn’t worked on the
project before. He helped me through linked lists using TDD, and I still refer back to that to this day to reinforce the approach. If I
were Turing, I would put a bug in his ear about sticking around maybe...

###### From Matt Hecker
I always notice your ability to subtly mediate a conversation during group retros and I appreciate it and I think its one of the reasons
our group retros are so productive. I think its excellent that you try to bring out the best of people in this way.

**Poopsicle:** That very same strength that mediates and mellows out conversations have, on very few and far between occasions, caused me to
censor myself when in retrospect I probably should have spoken up a little bit.

### Feedback from me

###### To Matt Ewell
Matt is a silent leader of 1507. He leads by example with his strong work ethic and determination to tackle hard problems. He also show
his genuine care for others in our community by helping people with code problems on a regular basis, and most impressively bringing in
a spaghetti dinner yesterday for students who were working on the final assessment.

###### To Jack Yeh
Jack was a great partner. I love how deliberate his thought process is when tackling a problem. Sometimes I felt like I would start
to sprint down one path of reasoning that wasn’t necessarily the best method, and in these sorts of situations Jack would typically
reign me back in and be a needed dose of skepticism until the idea we were juggling was fully fleshed out. On the same token, I thinks
sometimes Jack was a little too reticent to try out potential solutions to a problem, so potentially a little more cowboy coding might
serve him well. Also, I LOVE that Jack likes testing. Yay testing.

###### To Dave Maurer
Dave is a great learner. He has constant positivity and a strong work ethic. Even when some concepts don’t come immediately to him,
he puts in the hard work and leverages the malleable intelligence mindset to continuously grow and overcome challenges. I think sometimes
in the context of a project he could put more of an emphasis on TDDing parts of his code first that might drive him to come to a solution
quicker in the long run or be able to more effectively breakdown a complex problem.

###### To Matt Hecker
Matt has a heart of gold. Its clear that he always operates with a keen sense of wonder with regard to problem solving, and with best
intentions when interacting with classmates or group members. As a group member, Matt was always ready to share his knowledge with group
members, which was instrumental in developing my knowledge of HTTP, for instance. I think Matt can continue to focus on improving his
ability at empathizing with his partners mindset in social interactions to better develop his fluency with navigating the subtleties of
partner and group dynamics.

### Feedback For Staff

WHERE'S THE FEEDBACK APP???

### Playing a Part

This module I continued as much as possible to pop in on projects being worked on by students in lower modules. Typically I would help
them pass one small test or think through a solution to the current problem they were grappling with. Yesterday (1/20/16) I paired with
Alex and Matt for a few hours on the end of their Black Thrusday project. We passed one of their last tests from the spec harness and
submitted a PR to fix the wording of the project spec.

I also organized a guest-teaching trip to DSST College View Middle School (where I taught last year) for ~12 students from Turing. We
taught 8th grade students there the basics of HTML. Students there seemed to really enjoy seeing code they wrote immediately resulting
changed to the webpage they were looking at, and the participants from Turing said they had fun and enjoyed the experience. The computer
science teacher that I partnered with on this said that he would definitely be interested in bringing more Turing students/community members
back to represent the face of prgramming in the real world, as well as an example of adults continuing to value and pursue education.
