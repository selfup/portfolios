# Michael Wong - M3 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

My learning goals for this module were definitely to solidify my rails knowledge
and prevent slippage of skill.

### Attendance

I was present all days and late on one day though I don't recall which.

### Work

## Projects

### Team

I participated in the following team projects:

#### The Pivot

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/MikeJerrodTravis/the_pivot)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/apicurious.markdown)
( [Production URL](https://give-n-get-2.herokuapp.com/)

This project was designed for us to practice using legacy code and provide features
on top of it.

Team: Travis Haby, Michael Wong, Jerrod Junker

Assessed by: Josh M.

#### Notes

While the scores below seem to imply a weak project, the scores were a result of taking risks and challenging skill level. The team's skills are better as a result and this should be taken into account during portfolio reviews.
Pushing boundries of comfort level with jQuery. Attempting things more complicated than the other projects I assessed.
Styling could use more work.
jQuery cart is a good start but the interface needs polish. Some prices are using dollars and others are using cents. Email sent is not complete.
Good code quality and use of POROs

a test of our ability to turn user stories into features.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

Travis was awesome to work with, balancing motivation and calm. Most of our projects were individual so most feedback is pretty general to class.

### Playing a Part

The parts that I played this time include organizing a LAN party for the school, offering encouragement and advice to
newer students.
