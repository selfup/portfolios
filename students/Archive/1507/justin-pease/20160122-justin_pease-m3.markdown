### Areas of Emphasis

Not sure what to say about this module.  For the first time I was able to keep up and do well on my projects until the final personal project.  I ran into a lot of issues getting started with the right idea/api combination and lost a lot of time.  I had some challenges with one of the apis I ended up trying to use and with Heroku.  I learned a little about how I approach problems.  I need to slow down when I have a problem or a new technology to learn how it works.  I go to fast looking to just get things implemented that I don'w always understand the underlying structure and when there is an issue, it becomes difficult to debug.

### Projects

I participated in the following team projects:

#### The Pivot

* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/emilydowdle/the_pivot
* [Original Assignment] https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/the_pivot.md

In this project, we built upon an existing implementation of Little Shop. We transformed our restaurant ordering site into a platform that handles multiple, simultaneous businesses. Each business had their own name, unique URL pattern, items, orders, and administrators.

* Evaluation - https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1508/the_pivot.md
Group: Justin Pease & Emily Dowdle & Jason Pilz & John Slota

Assessed By: Andrew and Josh M.

GitHub: github.com/emilydowdle/the_pivot

Production Link: pivotproduce.herokuapp.com

Notes: 96% coverage and really good feature tests. Could use more model tests. Really good use of POROs. Over use of helpers in controllers, should be moved to helpers directory. Nice attempt at moving that logic out of the views though.

UI was really intuitive and looked good, but the seed file was not implemented to the extent required so it could have been painful if it was. Some items didn't link to muti-tenant url structure. Adding store appeared to be successful, but didn't work on the side of the user made as an admin

Scores

Product and Feature Delivery

Completion: 2.5 ** talk to josh
Organization: 4
User Experience: 3
Technical Quality

Test-Driven Development: 3+: Project shows adequate testing (90% - 95% coverage).
Code Quality: 3+: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.


#### Api Curious

* [GitHub URL] - https://github.com/Jpease1020/Curious-Tweets
* [Original Assignment] -https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/apicurious.md

In this project, we'll be focusing on consuming and working with data from public APIs.

As a vehicle for learning this concepts, we'll be selecting an API from a popular website and working to re-construct a simplified version of the website's existing UI using their own API. For example, you might decide to use the Twitter API to build a basic version of the Twitter feed where users can view and post tweets.

As we build these features, we'll also be working with the OAuth protocol to authenticate our users with the third-party provider, and using various testing techniques to allow us to test against the third-party data.


* Evaluation

Evaluation

You'll be graded on each of the criteria below with a score of (1) well below expectations, (2) below expectations, (3) as expected, (4) better than expected.

Notes: Retweeting and Unfollow user extensions. Test suite does not run. UX was really nice. No service object. All queries were happening in the user model.

#### Rales Engine

* [GitHub URL] - https://github.com/Jpease1020/Rails-Engine
* [Original Assignment] - https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/rails_engine.md

In this project, you will use Rails and ActiveRecord to build a JSON API which exposes the SalesEngine data schema.

#### Self Directed Project

* [Original Assignment] - https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/self_directed_project.md

The goal of this project is to create a successful web application from a project idea. You will create an app that will authenticate with a third-party service, consume an api, and solve an actual problem.


## Community

This module I really enjoyed working with some of the module 1 students.  I had weekly pairing sessions with Deborah Hamel and Matt Packer for the first 4 weeks.  I was also able to give a lesson on the object model for the 3rd week as a Friday student led session.

### Giving Feedback

Jason Pilz “Jason was a great team member during the pivot project.  He is well organized in thought and work practices which is an place I am weak so the complimentary qualities was great to have.  He is a strong coder and a good guy to work with."

John Slota
"John was a great guy to work with.  At times the group had a little too much stress and John was the balancing factor.  He was always in a positive mood and calm which can be a really big deal when woking in a stressful environment.  His code was solid and I really enjoyed working with him."

Emily Dowdle

“Emily was really good to work with.  She was nominated as team lead and did a fantastic job.  I am a person that needs external structure and Emily provided that.  She had a good sense of the project from day 1 and was able to balance organizing the team, producing code, and her family all at the same time for our Pivot project.    She was able to grow and adapt to the needs and intricacies of the team members in her leadership role.  I had a lot of fun working with Emily and the team."

Alon Waisman
Alon paired with me this module almost weekly.  He is always helping someone.  One area I think that may hold hi back id he has a somewhat black and white way of doing things.  What he think…..he really thinks, and what he doesn’t like he really doesn’t like.    It may prevent him from seeing things in new ways which is essential for growth.   Thanks for the super berries experience.

Mimi Schatz
Mimi was a great help.  She paired with me this module and was a joy to work with.  She was patient and insightful.  She needs to be a little better at communicating schedule times.  But she made learning fun.

### Feedback Received

Emily Dowdle
"Justin is personable and brought balance to the personalities in the group. He’s a hard worker, regularly staying late to finish a piece of code. He’s open to pairing and receives feedback incredibly well. I enjoyed working with him."

John Slota
“Justin was a great team player during tour pivot project. He had taken a module off before so was a little rusty taking off the previous module but his skills quickly came back to him and he was a great contributor to the project. He was able to work hard and stay at Turing until the project was done. I would be honored to work with him again"


Jason Pilz [9:43 AM]
“During our pivot project, Justin was a pleasure to collaborate with, his pairing skills are very high, and it was always apparent he was pushing himself to improve his skills. I admired his determination, as most nights he spend very long hours working on his assigned task to improve our project. I enjoyed working on a team with Justin and look forward to it again in the future.

Matthew Packer [9:09 AM]
“Justin reached out to me early in the module and offered to schedule a weekly morning pairing session. I really appreciated the support and guidance from a student that has been through the process. Justin has a talent of breaking down a problem in a way that is easy to follow and understand. One of our most helpful sessions involved understand how the code is actually ran. For example, after Justin explain the process, he would have me explain it back to him to confirm my understanding. I thought that vocalizing the process helped me better understand the process."


### Playing a Part

The biggest part I played was pairing with mod one students who were new and needed some help understanding this new world of code.  Having struggled though mod 1 I really enjoyed being able to help out people who were in a place I was in not to long ago and understand.  

I also gave  a student led session on the object model at the end of week three for the mod 1 students.  I wanted to give them a lesson in on one of the most important things they will learn here from the perspective of someone close to where they are at in their education process.  I feel that I was able to bring it across in the terms they were familiar with.
