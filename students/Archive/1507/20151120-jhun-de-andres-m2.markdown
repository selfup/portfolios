# Jhun de Andres - M2 Portfolio

### Areas of Emphasis

Coming into this module I didn't really know what to expect. I knew that I was basically at the bottom of the barrel and I wanted to improve.  I knew that we'd be doing rails and online applications which was super exciting but I knew that with the prework I'd need to really emphasize personal study. So I would look over the tutorials and make sure I understood the muscle memory involved in rails applications.

### End of Module Assessment

Instructor: Andrew
challenge: user
notes: Great work overall. Some shortcomings at first with testing but was able to generate all the content himself. Developer is very comfortable with the CLI and was impressive with workflow. Was a little confused about implementation of iterating through an associated collection in the view but was able to collaborate and figure everything out. Great work.

### Projects

I participated in the following team projects:

#### TrafficSpy

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/edgarduran/traffic-spy-skeletont)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/traffic_spy.markdown)

This was our first big projected that put an emphasis on Active record and where code goes in a CRUD application.

rubric:
  Functional Expectations: 3
  TestDriven Development: 3.5
  Encapsulation / Components: 2.5
  Fundamental Ruby & Style: 2.5
  Sinatra / Web and Business Logic: 3
  View Layer: 3

#### Little Shop of Orders

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jcasimir/robodoku)
* [Original Assignment](http://github.com/turingschool/challenges/robodoku.markdown)

This was our final rails project. Though our scores aren't the best I feel good about my code contribution. This was the first project where I didnt feel like I had no idea what was going. I implimented my first extension, and I felt comfortable doing work alone. It felt good knowing the reps I was putting in where starting to pay off.

  instructor_evaluation:
  notes: "bugs / inconsistent behavior through user and admin experience, check duplicated headers/footers, like to see PORO to handle order creation (push logic down the stack), remove admin logic from regular controllers, mostly good test coverage -- a little lite on model tests, check robustness of tests to ensure tests catch bugs/missing features"
  rubric:
    Feature Completeness: 1.5
    Views: 3
    Controllers: 3
    Models: 3
    Testing: 3
    Usability: 1.5
    Workflow: 4


### Feedback to Me

Here is what people had to say about me:

Jhun was a joy to work with. His sense of humor and awesome personality made working on our project really fun. He has one of the best work ethics of any person that I have worked with and it shows in the work he produced. I would definitely work with Jhun on any project in the future.

-Ryan Johnson

Working with Jhun was absolutely fantastic.  We had talked that this was our first group project where we both felt that we were able to contribute freely and without judgement.  Jhun is a fast coder and I was really impressed with his ability to troubleshoot some problems that came up.  Jhun is going to make a great developer. Thanks Jhun!

-Charissa

Working with Jhun was an absolute pleasure. His insistence on slowing things down to make sure we understood the code we were implementing really helped me learn on this project.  He is a hard worker and an awesome person, I would gladly work with him again.

-Edgar Duran

Jhun had such a positive energy during our Traffic Spy project, he was instrumental in keeping our team spirits up, even when we got stressed. I loved his enthusiasm and curiosity. His communication skills are through the roof, and he shows a unique ability of knowing what his weak spots are and going after them. Thanks for you!!
