# Regis Boudinot - M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Mission Statement

This module I want to teach more people about DevOps and enable them to be able to teach DevOps once I am done. I also want to learn Python while learning ES6. I also want to focus on the job search. So some projects might take a hit from doing so, but the point system was built with this in mind! I am also excited to learn more about Node and Express!

### End of Module Assessment

* Did not have to take the final :)

* Total Points: 923/1104

### Attendance

This module I attended all days and classes.

### Homework

Points: 226/229

### Work

#### IdeaBox

* [GitHub Url](https://github.com/selfup/idea_box_js)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/revenge_of_idea_box.markdown)

* Points: 159/150

In this project, I made IdeaBox again using jQuery, AJAX, and a Rails API. This was the first project of the module and it felt like being thrown into a volcano. I learned a ton and really enjoyed finishing it!

Notes: Refactor Ajax calls and use ```replace``` instead of ```remove```/```append```. Good use of ES6.

#### ThoughtBox

* [GitHub Url](https://github.com/selfup/thoughtbox)
* [Original Assignment](https://gist.github.com/stevekinney/82831c5b25029415ce8b)

* Points: 40/100

In this project, I had 7 hours to make most of a CRUD app in Rails with a JavaScript front end. Unfortunately I was deep in the job search and had 2 phone interviews as well as a code challenge that day. Really enjoyed the challenge but my plate was full! At this point I knew I had enough points to be able to take a hit. Thankfully the point system was built with this in mind.

#### Real Time

Title: Crowdsource

* [GitHub Url](https://github.com/selfup/crowdsource)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/real_time.markdown)
* [Production Link](https://warm-anchorage-1924.herokuapp.com/)

* Points: 153/200

In this project, I worked with Node, Express, and Socket.io to create a real time voting app. This project was really tough. It had the feeling of learning LinkedList for the first time. The amount of abstraction was quite large at first. Going deep into javascript was the way out, and enabled me to think in complex ways. I really enjoyed building the data structures for this project.

Notes (My Own): Learned a lot! Was busy helping people with their own projects and putting out Digital Ocean dumpster fires.

Notes (Horace):

* functionality is solid - works well with no hiccups; effectively satisfies expected use cases
* UI is nothing fancy but is clean and easy to follow. Adds enough color and a standard design
palette to make things feel unified.
* Workflow is solid - lots of branches and commits; seems to have an effective process around tracking
progress
* Server side code is overall pretty easy to follow; major weakness is the size of the main namespace --
next steps might be to look at pulling this apart
* Separating the app logic more explicitly would help make the connections between the pieces more
obvious
* Additionally would probably make testing easier since we would have more explicit insight into
the connections between pieces of our system

### Personal Project (Non Curriculum Based)

* [GitHub Url](https://github.com/selfup/DevOpsOne)

#### DevOpsOne

Notes: Did this during the 2 weeks break. Learned more about Linux than I could have imagined.

Purpose: To dive deeper into DevOps and learn how to script in Python as well as Ruby. This repo can setup up fresh Debian based VM's/VPS's/Desktops in around 6 minutes with Ruby/Rails/Node/Postgres and more.

Eventually I branched off and learned Docker. I can build an initial Docker container by cloning this repo and running my scripts in the Dockerfile in around the same amount of time. Then once the provision has been cached, spinning up new containers takes about 1 to 2 seconds.

## Team

* [GitHub Url](https://github.com/selfup/game-time)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)
* [Production Link](http://selfup.me/game-time)

#### Game Time

* Points 345/300

In this game I built a game that is playable in the browser. There is no server-side component for this project. I used client-side JavaScript exclusively to complete this project. My partner was Zach Routhier and it was interesting working on a project with someone that was auditing the course.

Notes (My Own): Really really enjoyed this project. Opened my eyes on how complex static apps can be. This is where I dove deep into ES6.

Two blog posts were written by Zach and myself.

### Feedback to Me

#### Adam Jensen:

#### "GOOD" STUFF

If you could sum Regis' personality into just a couple words, I would propose the words "Helpful" and "Knowledgeable."

##### EX:1
To dive a bit deeper, I mean, Regis has saved me from deep shit a couple of times. During Rales-Engine 1.0, Regis single handedly kept me from hitting my head on the wall after finding out helping diagnose my app with a deadly problem, It was using SQLite3. While I was sitting there wondering why ActiveRecord was so dumb, Regis helped my for over an hour and basically re-config'd my DB.yml. He could have been stressing along with everyone else that night. But he was calm and took time to help me. Regis is probably the only one in the school that night that would have been able to help me. Regis always knows stuff that other's don't. Why? Probably because of the countless hours the dude spends reading about Chef, or Space, or Unix etc. #mindblown

##### EX: 2
Oh yea, and there was another time that I wiped my OS with a fresh install and Regis basically helped me build a new Dev ENV in like 30 minutes. The funny thing is that he was enjoying it...

Summary: Regis helps everyone! He Helps mod 1-4 students. He helps Reddit by answering Rails Q's. He doesn't ever stop.

#### "BAD" STUFF

I used to think that Regis Stressed a lot. Back in M1, I do think that he would stress himself out a bit. But, really, I can't fault him.

One Criticism. Regis tends to go quickly sometimes. Regis can explain things very well, but sometimes doesn't. But then again, I can usually call him out and he realizes that he needs to explain something again and he's cool with it. The cool part is that he never gets upset of frustrated. It's kind of funny actually. Regis is just REALLY into everything. It's hard to keep up.

#### Meeka:

You’ve put in a lot of work this module, and I suspect all the past modules. Good work! Specifically, good job on managing the Game Time project. It’s a kudos to both you and Zach that you both kept your enthusiasm up through the whole project and tackled some really cool challenges, especially when Zach wasn’t tied, point-wise, to completing the project.

**I’m really impressed with how much work you and Jeff put into helping other classmates. It’s a very good sign that Josh would want to rope you into PR evaluations for Ricky. I assume it means that he views you as technically competent, well organized, and a good leader and encourager.**

*I can’t say all positive things, or this would be a silly bit of feedback, so I would caution you about going in technical rabbitholes. I think you’re more than capable of tackling extra complexity like deploying to digital ocean, or jumping into es6-land. Keep in mind that every extra level of cool, complicated tech that you add to a project is also technical debt. For example, I worked on a client project that was written in all cutting edge tech including React, like, the first month React came out. It was a ​_shit show_​. Even though the tech was well chosen, the problem was that only one or two developers on the team understood the full stack. So it was a HUGE block that prevented all of the other, more junior developers from committing code quickly, and they frequently broke things.
It might have theoretically been a more efficient app, but in reality, it was a hot mess and the company actually went under. Every day that I worked on the project, we were like ‘Why didn’t they just use rails?”. Their devs knew rails, the app was only going to get used by ~5,000 users… there was honestly no reason other than the lead dev’s ego for the weird Frankenstein stack.*

Introducing 1508 and below students to Digital Ocean has already caused them and you technical debt, in that you’re their only source. Doesn’t mean introducing new tech is a bad idea, but weigh the other side of the equation, because new tech isn’t as important, usually, as shipping, having a friendly code base for people to work on, and being able to hire developers that can work in the code base!

#### Bret:

Regis is one of the most enthusiastic people I met while at Turing and one of most inspiring. The Regis from module one (where I believe he struggled a bit) to the Regis of now is like a whole new person. His knowledge of dev ops and his passion for learning about an assortment of dev ops related materials is amazing. Not only did he teach himself all these things, he selflessly taught other people. I can remember being in my own wormhole of code in regards to the asset pipeline in Rails. Regis took time away from his own project ( when he had little time to finish it) and help me. Thank you Regis.

One area of improvement would be he sometimes can more difficult than they need to be BUT he always sorts it out in the end - though I also do this...

## Community

### Giving Feedback

**Adam is a JavaScripter.**

His interest in promises, closures, and all that is new JS frameworks is contagious.

He continuously pushes why it’s so great!

His second time through Module 3 has shown a lot of improvement. He has a lot less stress, and seems to really enjoy the deep learning of what he already did!

*The only negatives I have for Adam is that he can bring people down with him when he gets sad. The same can be said for me though. So this is more of a description on how much people care about him.*

**Bret is quite the character.**

He is always finding the strangest bugs and seems to enjoy tracking them down. While he does spend an insane amount of time encountering bugs that none of us have encountered, he also spends time helping people fix other issues. He has become an excellent debugger and his javascript skills have surprised me.

*The only negative I have for Bret is that he can go get lost in the back of classroom A and when he gets stuck he doesn’t reach out for help.*

Otherwise Bret has been a great contributing member to the cohort and turing itself!

Keep crushin’ it!

### Playing a Part

* I helped set up 5 students on Digital Ocean running production environments. One of them is in Module 2!
* Wrote 4 Blog Posts during Mod 4. Here is a link to my [Blog](https://medium.com/@rboudinot)
* Every Sunday at 2 or 3 pm I taught a mix of Javascript/Arduinos/Raspberry Pi/Ruby for an hour or two
* The first week of the module I held a student led session on setting up a rails environment in a Vagrant Box (again). (10 students)
* The second week of the module I held a student led session on setting up a rails environment on Digital Ocean (again). (7 students)
* The third week of the module I held a student led session on setting up a production environment on Digital Ocean (again). (5 students)
* During the 2 week intermission break I learned how to use Docker and made my own automation scripts for setting up fresh Debian based VPS's/Desktops/VM's. The script repo also includes scripts to setup a production environment for rails apps on both OSX and Debian based machines. I use my automation scripts in my Dockerfile to set up containers from scratch.
* During Field Day I held a 3 hour session on learning Python as well as OOP in Python. (10 students)
* Helped Mod 4 students when I had time to kill or paired during complex problem solving scenarios
* Helped Mod 3 Students kill bugs that were crucial to keeping them going (Javascript, Rails, Digital Ocean)
* Helped Mod 2 students with their Ruby skills to ensure their success
* Helped Mod 1 students with setting up their computers, understanding enumerables, and pulling information out of hashes
* As of Wednesday of this week these are my GitHub Stats:
