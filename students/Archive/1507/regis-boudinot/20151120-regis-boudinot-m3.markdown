# Regis Boudinot - M3 Portfolio

## Individual

### Mission Statement

This module I want to increase my understanding of Rails, and increase my understanding of DevOps. I have so far given back to the community as much I can with DevOps and I hope to be able to continually do so. This is such an important skill that we should all know, and I am glad to teach those willing to learn. I also want to get people more into hardware. I never really knew how to program before I came to Turing, and I want to be able to do cool stuff with hardware. My Personal Project will be hardware based if it gets approved and I am excited to learn what is not taught!

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### APIcurious

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/selfup/API-Curious)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/apicurious.md)

In this project, I used Rails, GitHub OAtuh, and the GitHub API to learn about API's and OAuth.

It was evaluated by Josh M. with the following results:

* Features: 3
* Interface: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 4
* Server-Side Application and APIs: 4

#### RailsEngine

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/rails_engine.md)

In this project, I used Rails and ActiveRecord to build a JSON API which exposes the SalesEngine data schema.

It was evaluated by Jorge with the following results:

* Completion: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 4
* Code Quality: 4

Title: WhereAmI?

In this project I update LCD screens with useful information for students to know what classroom they need to go to in the morning.

It was evaluated by Josh M. with the following results:

Notes: Sacrificed some UX for the challenge of working with hardware. IMO it was worth the trade off. Project demonstrates understanding of the learning goals expected.

* Completion: 4
* Organization: 3

It was evaluated by Mike with the following results:

"Twilio verify phone number on login. - there are charts and graphs and progress bars. - 96.23 percent coverage - 100 tests. - Some opportunities to refactor, perhaps look at decorators. - Some sweet graphs - last tweet from candidate - Amazing hero image. <3"

### Feedback to Me

I was told:

"Best group ever! I think we all worked together super well, never got too stressed, and got to do lots of cool things. I especially appreciated your enthusiasm and excitement throughout the project, I think it added a lot to the group dynamic. You’re also constantly curious, and always wanting to try new stuff, and I appreciate that too. I’m not sure if I really have a poopsicle for you, that project was an absolute blast the whole way through."

"Working with you was nothing but positive. Your knowledge for dev-ops is obvious and it was awesome that you wanted to share that with us. Figuring out two-factor auth with the phone was skillful. I always knew I could count on you to work hard, and we all worked so well together, it’s definitely been my favorite group experience. Your enthusiasm towards learning to code, doing a good job on the project, and being a good team member made you a pleasure to work with."

## Community

### Giving Feedback

I gave feedback to a number of my classmates and they were happy that my
feedback was actionable and supportive.

Here are some examples:

"Jeff: Was the best team lead I have had yet. He was not aggressive, and was not too laid back. He let the team work on their ideas and gave mini deadlines to be sure we weren’t getting lost. He really helped improve my experience at Turing. I never felt pushed, and he was also reassuring. The only poopsicle I can think of for Jeff is that he might be too laid back but other than that he has a really good head on his shoulders."

"You were a great example of a hard worker. Your talent for figuring out the front-end and helping your teammates when they are stuck is what made working you an awesome experience. You understand git workflow very well, and are a very quick learner. Our group was by far the best group I have ever worked with in a deadline based project where our knowledge was tested. I wish I had something negative to say so that you could build on some skills you need help with, but your intuition for figuring out problems and being self aware seems to bring you forward. I look forward to working with you again!"

### Playing a Part

* During the leading intermission week I helped setup computers for 1510. I also gave a talk with 1508 about what to expect.
* The first week of the module I held a student led session on setting up a rails environment in a Vagrant Box. (12 students)
* The second week of the module I held a student led session on setting up a rails environment on Digital Ocean. (12 students)
* The third week of the module I held a student led session on setting up a production environment on Digital Ocean. (10 students)
* The fifth week of the module I held a student led session on programming Arduinos with Ruby and C.
