# Regis Boudinot - M2 Portfolio

## Individual

### Mission Satement

My Mission this module is to help the incoming cohort as best I can while
managing my heavy workload and teaching others about new topics.
I want to teach people more about GNU/Linux and DevOps because I find
those areas of technology to be fascinating. My passion for learning about new
technologies is ever growing and I hope to be able to give back my knowledge as
well as give back to the community new and interesting ideas.

### End of Module Assessment

#### Instructor - Andrew

#### Challenge - Highest Scoring Word

#### Notes -

"Nervous but came through and performed well. Threw some unused things at him
and he was comfortable with implementing them with some collaboration. We ran
into a road block while passing through params that I couldn't figure out right
away either, but we collaborated and came to find the issue. Was well aware of
tools to use for troubleshooting and was aware of good testing practices. Was a
little shaky with minitest but could articulate what he would have done
with RSpec and we moved on from there."

"Overall a solid performance. Syntax and styling was good."

* Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking: 3
* Ruby Syntax & Standard Library: 3
* Rails Syntax & API: 3
* Rails Style: 3
* Testing: 3
* Collaboration: 3

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

##### Mod2-Individual-Work

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/selfup/mod2-individual-work)

This was a repo I made that has all the work I did this module.

It contains my ruby exercises that I was recommended to work on as well as my
Individual work I was recommended to complete in Module 2.

## Team

#### Traffic-Spy

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/dastinnette/traffic-spy)
* [Original Assignment](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/traffic_spy.html)

In this project we created a sort of Google Analytics clone that was fed
information through curl commands and displayed that information in organized
fashion on a website powered by Sinatra.

"Missing error message for 403s. OS, Screen Res, and Browser breakdown is incomplete."

* Functional Expectations: 1.5
* Test-Driven Development: 4
* Encapsulation / Components: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Sinatra / Web and Business Logic: 3
* View Layer: 3

Feedback:

"Appreciate how you were patient when there was more than one person pitching an idea."

"Good strong work ethic and genuine enjoyment with front-end development."

#### Little-Shop-Of-Orders

##### Dad Jokes


Assessor: Mike

Notes:
â€‹
"It actually tells me dad jokes - Cannot update items - You can apply any joke to any item - 127 tests - 97.5 percent coverage - Some opportunity to clean controllers - Minor places where some logic could be pushed down or out"

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/HoffsMH/dad_jokes_for_days)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown)

In this project my group and I used Ruby on Rails to build an online commerce
platform to facilitate online ordering.

* Feature Completeness: 2
* Views: 4
* Controllers: 3
* Models: 4
* Testing: 3
* Usability: 3
* Workflow: 3

Feedback:

"He is a fun guy to hang out with and is liked by everyone.  He is a very good programmer, but being easy to be around is so valuable when working long hours.  It made the project lighter woking with him and this project was long and stressful for me so I am glad he was there."

### Feedback to Me

"Intensely patient, Regis is one of the people around Turing you know that you
can always go to for quality and attentive help on any issue. A real credit to
the Turing community. Immensley curious and a fantastic teacher, his
excitement is contagious."

"Regis was more helpful than I could have imagined this module. He was always willing to drop what he was doing to help me out. Not only was he checking in on how school was going, but he was checking in on how life was going, which I really appreciated.  His attitude towards learning is motivating, and his thirst for knowledge is insatiable. There is nothing I could suggest to Regis that would improve his contribution to the community. He already goes above and beyond."

## Community

### Giving Feedback

"Provides great valuable feedback. Speaks his mind and gives you accurate and
actionable feedback when needing help with refactoring or building base logic.
Strong in ruby and very strong at testing. Chad is a valuable
resource that can be called upon at reasonable times."

"Ross has been a great part of his cohort community. He has a steadfast attitude and remains calm under pressure. He asks specific questions that can be answered quickly and his logical thinking patterns have gotten stronger since I saw him come in. Ross is a quick learner and seems to really enjoy his work and be proud of his code. I can see him being a strong member of the community as the breadth of his impact continues to grow. He could work on realizing when he gets stuck in logic holes, but he has gotten better since I pointed it out."

"Justin has improved a lot since his repeat of module 1. He seems to be absorbing the material at a healthier rate. Justin is a great person to be around and I look forward to keep working with him in the future. Justin actively seeks mentorship and asks a lot of questions but I think that he could benefit from trying to take a step back and learn more on his own. If he could spend a bit more time looking at the docs and re-reading them I think he would improve his absorption rate. His patience is a virtue and it is contagious in a good way."

### Playing a Part

* During intermission week I helped the incoming cohort setup their machines
and gave an hour long talk about what to expect and how to prepare.
* After Intermission setup I took part of the happy hour and got to learn
a good amount about the incoming cohort. Since their integration to Turing
I have seen them grow and have been impressed by their ability to tackle new
and interesting projects.
* I actively went out of my way to help Module 1 students to not only give
back my knowledge but to also keep up to date on my Ruby. I was impressed by
how strong their cohort was and I was always told that I was an appreciated
resource!
* On Friday, August 24th, I held a student led session on GNU/Linux and how to
mimic a DevOps environment. I gave instructions and how to setup a VM and boot
linux in a Virtual Box Machine. I also demonstrated how to customize a basic
Linux Distro and how to get Ruby, Node, and Rails.
* On Friday, September 25th, I performed well on giving my lightning talk about
Nuclear Fusion. People seemed very interested in hearing more about the topic.

## Review

### Notes

* Individual Work and Projects:
* Group Work and Projects:
* Community Participation:
* Peer and Instructor Feedback:

### Outcome

## A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations.

* 3: Student achieved a "3" or better on each category of the assessment

## B: Individual Work & Projects

A Turing student works to maximize their skill growth and demonstrates
that skill across a variety of work.

* 3: Student demonstrates commitment and growth in their work through satisfactory
evaluations of each project or a clearly upward-sloping trend.

## C: Group Work & Projects

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team

* 3: Student fully participates in their group work to facilitate group harmony
while achieving consistently satisfactory results.

## D: Community Participation

A Turing student builds up the community around them by participating and
supporting other students, the larger Turing family, and persons outside our
