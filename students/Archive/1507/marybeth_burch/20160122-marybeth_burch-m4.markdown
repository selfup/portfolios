# Mary Beth Burch - M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission

I am entering Module 4 excited to learn Javascript and client-side development. I know it will be a challenge, as it's something very new to me. At this point in my Turing career, I am getting better at learning and dealing with challenges. I want to continue doing my best and working hard, but I also want to be easier on myself and give myself credit for what I already know instead of getting frustrated by all I don't know. I'd like to experiment with different strategies in my code and try new ways of doing things. I want to remain focused on Turing and continue supporting our community, while also starting to look at next steps and be proactive in my job search.

### End of Module Assessment

n/a- Total Percentage for Module: 88.77%

### Attendance

This module I attended all days and classes on-time with the exception of an absence on December 18th when I was sick. I am consistently on time and try to do warm-up even if my posse isn't around.

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### Ideabox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mbburch/ideabox-js)
* [Production URL](https://ajaxinthebox.herokuapp.com/)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/revenge_of_idea_box.markdown)

This project is a basic app for recording ideas. I used JavaScript and jQuery to provide a responsive client-side interface. I used AJAX to communicate between client and server. A basic Rails app manages the data.

(evaluation comments) - None received.

#### Realtime

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mbburch/votestance)
* [Production URL](https://votestance.herokuapp.com/)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/real_time.markdown)

Our goal for this project was to build a real time application with WebSockets. I built a Node application using Express and Socket.io. The app allows users to create polls, share polls with voters, and gather votes in real time. The poll administrator can choose whether or not to share results with voters, and can set a time for the poll to automatically close.

Scores: 165/200 points
* Concept & Features: 75/100 (Met expectations as outlined by the user personas, the application is a solid first version. All planned features were delivered.)
* Code Quality: 25/30 (Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.)
* Client-Side Application: 30/30 (Your application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or now duplication and all components separated out into logical components.)
* Test-Driven Development: 25/30 (The code demonstrates high test coverage. It is tests at controller and unit levels. All controller/routes are tested. There are no failing tests.)
* Interface: 5/5 (The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use)
* Workflow: 5/5 (The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.)

#### Thoughtbox (Mock Assessment)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mbburch/thoughtbox)
* [Original Assignment](https://gist.github.com/stevekinney/82831c5b25029415ce8b)

This mock assessment was a one day project to test our knowledge of Ruby, Rails, and Javascript. I built a simple web app where users can save and read links. I used TDD to build Thoughtbox, and used AJAX to instantly update the page without refresh.

Scores: 100/100 points

* Completion: 75/75
* Hitting Goals: 25/25

## Team

### Projects

I participated in the following team projects:

#### Game Time

## Community

### Giving Feedback

* To Regis: "You never say no to anyone. People ask you for help all day long, and you are always willing. I love that anyone feels comfortable coming to you. My piece of advice would be to make sure you’re listening as much as you’re helping, to find out where others are at. Sometimes I felt like assumed I did (or didn’t) know things, when it wasn’t a correct assumption. Especially going into a new job, make sure you’re taking the time to really listen.”

* To Matt E.: "I appreciate how genuine you are. You know your stuff, but you are super humble about it. Thank you for wanting to build things that are real and useful to people. You are really patient, and explain things clearly whenever I ask you for help. You have a good balance of being self-effacing and confident, and I think it will serve you well as you move forward to make sure the confidence shows.”

* To Rose: “I’ve enjoyed checking in with you more this module, about the job hunt, and about projects. It’s nice to have someone looking for similar things in a job, and I like that you’ve made it feel like an open, productive conversation, rather than something competitive. You’ve also worked your ass off this module, and have really solid projects to show for it! It’s hard to think of advice, but I’d say it might be worthwhile to take some risks, try solving a problem in a new way, or go back and change something in an old project. I feel like you are so good about collaborating, sharing your thoughts, and working with others, but have also heard you talk a lot about the way other people did things. You know your shit, so try doing something differently, or in a way that pushes you.”

* To Deborah: “I’ve missed our posse time since break, and I hope you all end up reviving it next module! I loved having your positive energy to start every day. You definitely belong here, even though I’ve heard you express a little doubt at times. You ask great questions, and I appreciate how, in warm  ups, you’d always ask to slow down and make sure that you understood what was happening. Feel free to reach out anytime if you need pairing support or someone to work with!”

* To Beth Sebian: “You work your ass off here. I so respect your dedication to all things Turing, and to doing everything you can to be an amazing programmer. Someday I’ll feel smart enough for DSA. It seems like you fly under the radar and stay humble about how solid you are. I always appreciate warm-ups with you (before our posse stopped showing up) because you ask good questions, and push others to work through things together. I’m sad we never got the chance to pair on anything, and I hope we can still do your open data project together.”

* To Allan: “Remember how on your first day at Turing, you solved the warm up in a way none of us knew how to do?? I feel like I learned so much from working with you about how to see problems differently, and come up with creative solutions. I hope our posse pulls back together in the next few modules, and that you are able to reach out and be a strong support for mod 1 folks going forward. I can’t wait to see where you end up!”

* To Hector: “I love doing warm ups with you, because you are always ready to dive into a problem and work with others. You bring a real sense of confidence to your programming.  My piece of advice would be to stay flexible and try solving problems in different ways. Sometimes during warm-up, I felt like you had a solution you knew was right (and it was), but it made it hard to try things in a way that might be different. I think you will be a strong mentor for new students!

* To Jhun: “I always want someone as joyful as you in my life. You probably don’t know it, but on a lot of rough days, I’d get a big smile and a hello from you, and it made my day better. You bring such a much needed spirit to this place. I admire your commitment to young people, and to the community. I’d love to stay in touch and talk about cool projects together, and creative things we can do with programming.”

* To Russell: “I learned so much from working on Game Time with you. I have to admit, I went in a little skeptical after working together on Little Shop (and maybe you did, too), but I’m proud of what we built. Working with you encouraged me to branch out from my typical style and try things in a new way, which I really needed. I liked feeling a little unsure of where we were headed at times, and all the crazy stuff we did with using time helped me immensely in other projects. I felt like you were a more patient explainer this time around, and I really enjoyed working with you. Even though it seemed hard sometimes when you just wanted to do your own thing and run with it, you pushed yourself to be a clear communicator and work on things together. My biggest piece of advice would be time management and DTR stuff. Sometimes I was caught off guard when you would just leave, or when you needed to work on your lightning talk during the day. I sometimes felt abandoned, but we totally pulled it together and I shouldn’t have worried. I think as long as we both take more time with partners in the future to set clear expectations, things will work out fine.”

* To Bret: “You are so dedicated to your work. You put so much time into all of your projects, and produced amazing work because of it. I feel like I saw you show so much tenacity, because things didn’t always come easy, but you worked hard for it, and have great projects to show for it. You always share resources with the rest of us, so we don’t have to have the same painful process of discovery… You saved my ass with PryJS and testing resources for sure! I know it’s hard, but I hope you are able to find balance once you leave Turing. It seems like each module, you had nothing left at the end. Make sure you find ways to take care of yourself, stay curious about programming, and don’t burn yourself out too soon.”

* To Jill: “Thank you for being a reliable, Tuesday morning presence in my time at Turing. I appreciated having someone to be honest with about how hard it is to have a real life here (yay for life as a side project!). Even though you are working so hard, you manage to stay light hearted enough to keep the people around you laughing. I think, as you move into module three, that you’ll be a really important presence for women who might be coming into the program a little unsure.”

* To Justin H.: “You are one of the hardest people for me to really think of genuine advice for. You are one of the most curious, thirsty for learning people I’ve ever met. I love coming in the morning, and seeing you diligently taking notes from POODR. Part of what’s helped me really grasp things has been standing next to you while you take amazing notes and ask great questions. You never mind when I ask you to stop listening for a second and clarify something I missed. I appreciate that you’ve really focused on doing your best to take care of yourself too, and be a better person outside of programming. Because you’re always so damn happy and enthusiastic, it’s hard to tell sometimes how you’re dealing or if things are ever hard. My advice, then, would be to let people know when things are shitty sometimes and make sure you have a good support network for that. Find things that are genuinely really hard, that you just don’t get, and maybe try thinking about a project in a new way, and take a different approach. I think you’ll be an amazing mentor, and I hope that’s something you can give back to Turing!”

### Being a Community Member

* Russell says, "Being a homeschooled shut-in, one of my main goals for attending turing was getting better at working on a team. You're one of the people I've been paired with on multiple projects. It's a good experience because it lets us see how our team-working ability improves over time, and I feel like this was definitely the case working with you. Things were a bit ugly on our first project, and you were very supportive and instructional to my trying to be a better team member. I remember that my feedback from last project was about how much you worried, and I didn't feel that at all this project. This was the most productive team experience I've had, and I think it's largely due to us figuring out how to work better with each other. I'm not sure what criticism to give, just keep working on nervousness I suppose. I think you'll do fine."

* Bret says, “MB is one of the hardest workers of our module. Whenever I see her, she is focused on some project; working diligently late into the night. She crushed module 4 and with each subsequent module, she became a more confident and capable programmer. She was also quite giving - sending out valuable information on slack on a daily basis. Like me, I hope we are able to find balance after leaving Turing. From our first drink at the Mexican place across to street - to scrambling to find feedback at the end of module 4, it was was always a pleasure being at Turing with you.”

* Regis says, "You are a rockstar. In Mod 1 you struggled as most of us did. In Mod 2 you seemed to start really enjoying things. Then in Mod 3 as a good amount of us did you flew away in a rocket ship. Ever since you “clicked” you just crushed it. My advice to you is that you need to manage stress a bit better. You seem to enjoy what you do, but sometimes you you get this tunnel like vision when you run into an issue. Otherwise keep being as nice and helpful as you are!"

* Matt E. says, "When I think of what 1507 embodies, or what I would want for it to embody, I think of MB. She works very hard and I think her academic success shows that. I was inspired that she was working to be a part of a company that supported education and disappointed that it didn't work out (although the more I hear about the company the more I see that was probably a good thing). One of my shortcomings is that I don't know many people on a deep level so any of my observations are from a bit of a distance. But as for anything to improve, I know that I get emotionally attached to results, and I see a bit of that in MB as well. If I participate in the process and am open to whatever the results are, things are fine, and when I think I know what an outcome should be, I struggle. But perhaps if this were good advice I'd be able to follow it more myself. Thanks for being a part of our group."

* Justin H. says, "Seeing your journey from almost no experience whatsoever to a professional bad ass has been awesome!
You have a dynamite combination of perseverance, persistence and maybe a little bit of stubborness thrown in for good measure.
You were definitely one of the hardest workers in the cohort and seem to be extremely disciplined (I remember talking to you about spending money and you said you hadn't bought a lunch at Turing yet... at all).
If I could offer you feedback for improvement I would say to not get intimidated by some of the more "data science-y" things. They aren't harder than the stuff you've already been learning and you definitely have the brain power to figure it out!
Overall, great job these 7 months. You have great things in store for you!"

* Horace says, "MB is the hero we need," because I'm a reliable coffee maker.

### Playing a Part

* I facilitated a student-led session on Sonic Pi.
* Weekly participant in the Joan Clarke Society
* I was a new student buddy and reached out to students in modules one and two.
* I attended improv, and found that most of the activities done were ones that I had facilitated as an instructor. I've been thinking about how I can use my resources like this to help Turing.
* I pick up after others, run the dishwasher, and do some cleanup every day.
* I'm present for warm-up every day and actively contribute. I try warm-up even when I'm the only one from my posse.
* I went to meetups to try and connect with the larger community. I'm trying to help re-organize the Women Who Code Ruby study group.
