## Individual

### Your Mission

I will continue to be intentional about bringing a positive attitude and a growth mindset each day. I will get better at embracing road blocks, and draw on my tenacity and creativity when it comes to working through challenges, but I will ask for help from mentors and others before I get to the point of beating my head against a wall. I think I get better at this each module. I will do my best to look outside of myself every day and notice others who might need support or encouragement. I will try not to compare myself to others and work on making myself the best programmer I can be. I will begin to actively explore where I hope to land after Turing, and seek out people and organizations that are combining technology with other issues and fields that I care about. I will not eat junk food just because it is on the table. I will try my best to learn something new that is not what we are doing in class (Javascript, etc.).
​
### Attendance

This module I attended all days and classes on-time with the exception of an absence on Wed., Nov. 4th for a family medical concern. I am consistently on time and ready to help my posse with warm-up every day.

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### API Curious

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mbburch/tinyposts)
* [Heroku URL](https://tinyposts-mb.herokuapp.com)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/apicurious.md)

Notes: I was initially incredibly intimidated by this project, and wasn't quite sure how to get started. I think I did a good job of seeking out help from others and working through my own frustration, although I felt like this might have been my toughest moment thus far in the program. A day in to the project, a lot just seemed to click. I'm excited to keep working with API's that I find relevant to the work I would like to do, and try hand rolling with Hurley on future projects.

I received the following feedback and scores:

* Completion: 3.5
* Organization: 4
* Test-Driven Development: 4
* Code Quality: 4
* User Experience: 3.5

#### Rails Engine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mbburch/rails-engine)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/rails_engine.md)

Notes: I was dreading this project because of the tight timeframe and the fact that I've been enjoying more of the front-end work this module. It took me awhile to get started, as I ran into issues pulling in the CSV's. I ended up really enjoying this project, and found the Active Record and Ruby practice so helpful. I felt like I was efficient with using the documentation and did a much better job than I usually do at asking for help at just the right time. I let myself struggle, but asked for support before digging myself into a hole I couldn't get out of.

I received the following feedback and scores:

* Completion: 4
* Test-Driven Development: 4
* Code Quality: 3
* API Design: 3
* Queries: 3+

## Team

### Projects

I participated in the following team projects:

#### The Pivot

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mbburch/the-pivot)
* [Heroku URL](https://bidday.herokuapp.com)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/the_pivot.md)

Notes: My group started out with one code base, and switched to another after two days. I think we did well dealing with the pressure of this. We had a few communication issues along the way, but mostly felt like we had balanced voices. I was disappointed we didn't get to meet some of my goals of implementing Twilio or Stripe. I'm still hoping to learn those at some point. For our project, we took a micro-lending platform and pivoted to an auction site. My biggest takeaway from this project was probably implementing multi-tenancy, and learning to work with an existing code base.

My group received the following feedback and scores:

Notes:

* Paperclip implemented.
* 86 tests
* 98.85 percent coverage
* Some database-y stuff in the views.
* good looking site

Scores:

* Feature Completeness: 3
* Organization: 3
* Progress: 3
* TDD: 3
* Code Quality: 3
* UX: 3

I received this feedback from one of my partners: *GOOD*​: MB is super incredible and persistent. Many times, when a problem was preventing us from going forward… I was at that point where I wanted to hit the drawing board again and start with a new Idea, but MB would happily say something like “Hold on for just one second, I need to finish reading this ..” I admire this. It’s super helpful when hitting walls all day. Not only that, MB is incredibly patient as we had about a 3 day period of being stuck and confused. I didn’t see MB great frustrated at all and she handled it very well. I also like that MB is down to pair. No everyone is. Working with MB… I noticed that she was always the one inviting and encouraging the team to pair. Overall, she was very much the person that would remind us to review the latest PR and check in with progress. ​*BAD*​: This is a bit humorous. It sounds like I’m talking about myself…. but MB does seem to sometimes struggle with making a decision and going forward with that decision. This i OK, I do it too. A couple times, MB and I would be pairing and We would both be tossing so many ideas, edge-cases, and what-ifs around, that we wouldn’t get much done. Like I said…It’s almost funny that we both did this. MB seems to pair better with a more decisive personality instead of someone like myself. CONCLUSION: MB was super awesome to work with and I only found her getting stronger through the 2 week project. By the end of the project, she was literally saving the day with small tidbits of project knowledge.

#### Schoolrunner Admin Sync Dashboard

* [GitHub URL-Private Repo](https://github.com/Schoolrunner/tssd-1507-b)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/self_directed_project.md)
* [Schoolrunner Specific Criteria](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cOphM8Wqt15RL06gbKcf7S88B6nAXc2VGkyN2zPlaxg/edit?usp=sharing)

Notes: I had been looking forward to the personal project for all of Module 3, as I was excited to really apply all that we've been learning and work on something creative and all my own. Upon finding out that Schoolrunner was reaching to some folks to work with their API, I made the choice to do that instead. I am very interested in Schoolrunner as a potential employer, but I chose to do this project for other reasons as well. I knew it would push me more to work with a partner again, particularly someone I had worked with in the past, since I felt I had grown a lot since working with him last. I also knew this project would push me to learn some skills outside of Ruby and Rails. I really enjoyed the challenge and frustration of working with Javascript for the first time, and I'm excited to keep working with it in Module 3. I feel like my partner and I worked together successfully to meet the requests of a "real-life" client.

My group received the following feedback and scores:

Notes: Good use of JavaScript. Polling data to update views. Clean abstractions.

* Completion: 4: Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set by the client in timely manner.
* Organization: 4: Developer used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.
* Test-Driven Development: 4: Project shows exceptional use of testing at different layers (above 95% coverage).
* Code Quality: 4: Project demonstrates exceptionally well factored code.
* User Experience: 3.5: Project exhibits a production-ready user experience.
* Performance: 4: Project pages load on average under 300 milliseconds.

I received the following peer feedback:

* I look forward to collaborating with you again: strongly agree
* I found our collaboration valuable and productive: strongly agree
* I feel you participated to the best of your abilities: strongly agree
* Comments: I have a tendency to dive down rabbit holes. You are fantastic at keeping me grounded and on task. Our Slack dialogue is evidence to your strong communication skills. You help me talk more through my coding when we are paired up.

## Community

### Playing a Part

* I volunteered to help host the Women Who Code Ruby study group, and I have attended each time it was held at Turing.
* I volunteered to help with Young Entrepreneurs and built a website for an aspiring food blogger.
* I planted the seed for a women's clothing swap that will be happening over intermission week, and I attend the Joan Clarke Society each week to connect with other women in the program.
* I've done a better job this module of getting to know people in modules one and two. I feel like I've met some cool people this module!
* I pick up after others, run the dishwasher, and do some cleanup almost every day. I make lots of coffee and teach new people how to make it, too.
* I'm present for warm-up every day and actively contribute. I've started trying to organize a posse gathering outside of school with mentors and have a little interest, but need to follow through.
