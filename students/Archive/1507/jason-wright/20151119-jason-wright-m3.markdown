### Your Mission

This module my focus was trying to change all the things I felt caused me to fail the last time. While I was preparing to retake the module I changed my sleep patterns, eating habits, and my workspace at home. I also tried to focus on having fun and not just going through the grind. I am still struggling with this, but I didn't watch myself burnout this time. One of the biggest issues I have faced at Turing is going down rabbit holes. I will spend three hours just trying to get one little thing working that isn't all that important to the overall project. When I see something that doesn't behave like I think it should I get mad and keep hacking at it until I figure out why or realize I just spent 3 hours on it. I am trying to be more aware of when this is happening or it I see it coming setting a timebox. I have also struggled with getting excited and researching all kinds of cool stuff and then falling behind just getting something basic going. I felt behind, and usually was compared to the class, on every individual project. I also started taking the weekends mostly off when no project was due. I would just read or play around with some stuff that I am interested in, like front-end frameworks and styling. I don't think that is a pattern I am going to carry forward, I am going to try and spend at least one full day a weekend either preparing for the upcoming project or working on something that will improve my workflow on the next project.  

I participated in more events this module than I have in any previous. Which was Denver RB, two improv classes, and did a student led session on Cloudinary, http://cloudinaryclass.herokuapp.com (never finished), where we also discussed .railsrc and template files to customize your rails new. At the beginning of the module I let my posse members and a few other people know I was always available to help but that didn't really work. I helped people in my new module over screen hero and at turing. I walked around sometimes just listening for problems but half the time I feel intrusive and possibly annoying so that is not something I pursued regularly.

One goal for the next module is to not be behind, or feel behind on the projects. To accomplish this I am going to figure out the absolute MVP and accomplish that. Which means fully tested and full ui before I even consider adding anything to the project. Health wise I am going to try and start exercising regularly. I would also like to try and create an app or a tutorial that is useful to other turing students.

### Work

I had three individual projects this module.


#### Apicurious

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/noobjey/noobtwit)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/apicurious.md#technical-expectations)
* [Heroku Deployment](https://noobtwit.herokuapp.com)

I consumed the twitter api to build a twitter clone.

##### Evaluation Scores

* Features: 3
* Interface: 4
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Server-Side Application and APIs: 3


#### Rales Engine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/noobjey/rails_engine)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/rails_engine.md)

I built an API that exposed Sales Engine data points using ActiveRecord.

##### Evaluation Scores

* Completion: 3: Project completes most requirements but fails 5 or fewer spec harness tests.
* Test-Driven Development: 4: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>90%) and tests at the controller and unit levels.
* Code Quality: 3: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.
* API Design: 3: Project uses strong and consistent data formats throughout, while relying mostly on standard Rails JSON features.
* Queries: 4: Project makes great use of ActiveRecord relationships and queries, including some advanced query functionality such as joins and includes.


#### Personal Project

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/noobjey/cannect)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/self_directed_project.md)
* [Heroku Deployment](https://cannected.herokuapp.com/)

I created a site to that allowed you to create groups of users and follow/unfollow groups or individuals on twitter and github.

##### Evaluation Scores

* Completion: 2
* Organization: 2
* Test-Driven Development: 4
* Code Quality: 3

## Team

### Projects

#### The Pivot (PhotosReady)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rasensio1/the_pivot)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/the_pivot.md)
* [Heroku Deployment](https://earforked.herokuapp.com)

I worked with Ryan and Alon on the pivot. In this project, we took [My codebase](https://github.com/noobjey/the_pivot) from last module's *Little Shop of Orders* and extended on it. We converted it to be a multitenancy site. Instead of food we converted it a platform for users to sell photos.


##### Evaluation Scores

* Implemented custom watermarks for each store.
* Added ability to download multiple photos by zipping them
* Overall solid project. Didn't put much effort into the front end. It used the same styles from the previous project.

* Completion: 4
