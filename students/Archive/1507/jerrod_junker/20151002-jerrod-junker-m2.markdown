        Feedback--

        Regis-

        I think that Jerrod is really smart and has a lot of knowledge to share. I wish he could be a bit more vocal but he has been working on that skill set and I can see a good amount of improvement on his part. I really enjoy talking to him about gaming and computers and I am excited to see him translate his skills learned at Turing into the gaming world.

    Feedback --

    Adam - 

    Good: Very sharp and I think you have a great personality. You are not overbearing and seem to bring good ideas. All of my interactions with you have been positive. I like to ask you questions, cause I know you have a lot to offer…BAD:  I would love to see a more direct and assertive approach. I feel that you might just be shy… but it can come across as not being engaged. For example, I always feel that you would rather work solo, so I usually just let you work solo. Outside of feedback… Seriously, let’s pair on future stuff.

Community
Giving Feedback
    Gave to Adam-
    Something you do well: You’re usually very open to trying things that you haven’t before and learn them in depth(like paperclip).  Something you could improve on: Seeking to pair with people more than you already do could be beneficial

    Gave to Regis-
    Regis is always talking about interesting new discoveries (see watercooler slack channel) and is always bringing interesting new ideas and technologies to projects as well. He’s also fun to talk to when it comes to gaming and computers and when he needs to is willing to put in a lot of hard work to get a project done.

    

Playing a Part
    Make sure I'm always curtious and prepared to help anyone who may need it.
    Worked on reaching out and becoming more of a part of turing in general.
    Offered to pair with anyone in 1508 multiple times.
    Paired with Nicole on her chisel project.

Outcome


## A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations.

* 4: Student achieved two or more "4s" on the assessment

## B: Individual Work & Projects

A Turing student works to maximize their skill growth and demonstrates
that skill across a variety of work.

* 3: Student demonstrates commitment and growth in their work through satisfactory
evaluations of each project or a clearly upward-sloping trend.

## C: Group Work & Projects

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, and delivers a high-quality product.

* 3: Student fully participates in their group work to facilitate group harmony
while achieving consistently satisfactory results.

## D: Community Participation

A Turing student builds up the community around them by participating and
supporting other students, the larger Turing family, and persons outside our
walls who want to develop their own skills.

* 3: Student participates in required activities and does at least one or two
above-and-beyond supports of the community.

## E: Peer & Instructor Feedback

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.

* 3: Student consistently delivers meaningful feedback for peers and implements
strategies to improve themselves in response to feedback.
