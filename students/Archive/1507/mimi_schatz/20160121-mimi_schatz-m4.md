# Mimi Schatz - Module: 4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Mission Statement

My goal this module was to stay motivated and focused despite the pressure to find a job. I was excited to learn a new language and hoped to find a hidden love for frontend development. I don't think that happened, but I discovered that it is a lot easier to learn a second language than it was to learn the first. I have learned a ton over the course of the last seven months and it still surprises me that I'm here at the end!

#### Feedback to me:

* From Jeff: I like this a lot, I really like how you're now telling the ball what to do instead of asking about it's state and making decisions based on that. It's pretty impressive how much code you were able to cut out with this change. Looks good to me!

* From Meeka: Hey Mimi, this is a great refactor and also, excellent .gif usage!

* From Bret: This was Mimi and Bret’s second time into the depths of hell. The first was Sales Engine - the second was Game Time. For  this project, we choose to work together so obviously I have no complaints. It was once again a pleasure to work with Mimi - she is a refactoring goddess and managed to make our project go from a tangled mess to a beautiful being. She was also a debugging and structuring wizard.

* From Justin: Mimi was a great help. She paired with me this module and was a joy to work with.  She was patient and insightful. She needs to be a little better at communicating schedule times, but she made learning fun.

#### Feedback from me:

* To Bret: Bret and I chose to work together for Game Time because we knew we would work well together and complete an assignment we would both be proud of. During the project I was not my usual pleasant self, but that didn’t phase Bret. He went above and beyond to get the project done. Bret is always willing to put in the time and effort necessary to complete a task. He is determined - almost stubborn - to figure out a problem and to understand it thoroughly. I’m going to be sad not to have the opportunity to work with him again!!

* To Jeff: These old folks seem unsure of their clapping. You can go ahead and clap. Small change but a good change!

#### Playing a Part

I've participated in the larger Turing Community in the following ways:

* Attended and led Women Who Code.
* Paired regularly with Justin Pease.
* Paired with students in 1511.
* Helped students in 1508 with their final projects.
