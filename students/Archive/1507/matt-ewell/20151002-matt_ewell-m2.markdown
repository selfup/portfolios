# Matt Ewell - M2 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

As in last module, I will try to learn the material that is presented, and be a part of the community. Last module I felt I was a bit blind as to how I spent my time and efforts, so this module, I will try to allocate my time more intentionally. Specifically, if it is an option, I will choose rest over attempting extensions to an assignment, and if rest is not needed, I will try to spend my time in a way that is most beneficial to myself and others. This could be learning more deeply, but if so, I will try to do that intentionally and for its own sake. In this way I hope to be able to be more present for lectures and in-school activities. I will try to stay true to my personal values and priorities while striving to comply with Turing's requirements.

### End of Module Assessment

Assessed By: Andrew Carmer

## Scores

1. Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking

- 3: Developer breaks complex problems into small, digestible steps and executes them

2. Ruby Syntax & Standard Library

- 4: Developer is able to comfortably implement solutions using the best-choice tools Ruby has to offer

3. Rails Syntax & API

- 3: Developer is able to utilize Rails methods and structures, but needs some direct guidance

4. Rails Style

- 3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack

5. Testing

- 3: Developer uses tests at multiple layers of abstraction to drive development

6. Collaboration

- 4: Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck

### Attendance

Here every day, before 9a almost every day.

### Work

No individual projects were assessed during this module.

## Team

### Projects

#### Traffic Spy

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/roseak/traffic_spy)
* [Original Assignment](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/traffic_spy.html)

Build a Sinatra app to parse incoming JSON data and display meaningful statistics for it.

My synopsis: I tried to go with the flow on this one, letting another take the lead, and pitching in where needed. I enjoyed the first group assignment, learning different techniques and tools from my teammates. I struggled with the lengthy discussions of minute details of the project. We got through it, though, and we were all pleased with both the outcome and the process. We didn't work unreasonable hours, at least not every day, and still learned a lot and received satisfactory marks.

#### Little Shop of Orders

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/plato721/givenget)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/project1.markdown)

Build a Rails e-commerce site. We chose to build a site that would allow (eventually) for both donation and low-cost goods and services.

My synopsis: This was a pile of work. I think we all learned a lot, and I think we put together a pretty decent project, especially in the back end. I was the "project manager" on this one, which was interesting. I was going to say it bore little resemblance to my experience with project management on the job, both as a contributor and lead, but in fact, it was plenty similar. PMs often lack real leverage, so it's about using whatever means they can to motivate and distribute the work.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

* Talked to Alon after his apology note to discuss some specific things that had bothered me
* Sent in weekly surveys
* Sent in mentoring survey
* Turing Posse Post -- Tuesday, September 8
** From Matt: "Thanks to Travis (1507) for the git/hub help. He said he would be there when I was in my first group project and made good on it."
* Provided detailed feedback for teammates on Traffic Spy
* Provided feedback to Ryan Asenio for his portfolio
* Provided feedback to Adam Jensen for his portfolio

### Getting Feedback

* Turing Posse Post -- Tuesday, September 8
** From Ryan: "Shout out to Matt Ewell for pulling weight in our project"
** From Cole: "shout out to Matt Ewell and Blithe Rocher for their patience and assistance with Mastermind"
* What's one thing I do well?
** Ryan: "Staying focused on the bigger picture of project."
** Adam: "Matt, you are a complete workhorse and a lot of our project was fueled by your constant working and strong ethic. I can confidently say that you have no issues with laziness whatsoever. 
I also noticed that you bring strong organizational skills to the team. I was happy to see this in a team lead. The work-flow was smooth most of the time and I felt that pacing was on point the entire project.
I would also note the you have an [sic] great collection of knowledge and experience!"
* What's one thing I could do better?
** Ryan: "Coping with people that think differently than you"
** Adam: "I want to proceed with caution here. But during our time together, I generally felt that you almost felt burdened by my approaches. This may not be the case at all all and probably does not reflect your actual attitude. However, approaching you can be pretty tough. If I could pinpoint the reason that I felt this way… it would be that it can sometimes seem that you don’t care for that particular interaction. Not a big deal, but can become overbearing overtime."

### Playing a Part

* Spent time with cohort mates and those from other cohorts via casual conversation, lunches, 7-11 trips, etc.
* Field day part 2
* Gave lightning talk on Cognitive Based Therapy techniques that have helped me personally
* For me, service is most beneficial when done anonymously, but some of the things I've done that are already known are:
** Addressing the coffee situation by providing a percolator. Over 60 cups per day were consumed from the start, and this number increased to over 80. This helped to keep students alert and save them money until the industrial machine went into production.
** Getting the 1507 cohort capybara, Clarence
** Making PRs on some assignments (Blogger and Contact Manager-- both merged)
* If the above isn't enough to continue at Turing, I can give details on some things that may not be known.

## Review

### Notes

( Leave blanks for reviewers )

### Outcome

## A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations.

* 4: Student achieved two or more "4s" on the assessment

## B: Individual Work & Projects

* 3: Student fully participates in their group work to facilitate group harmony
while achieving consistently satisfactory results.
