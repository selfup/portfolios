# Mimi Schatz - Module: 2 Portfolio

## Individual

### Mission Statement

My goal this module was to take more initiative leading in group projects and to feel more comfortable with my knowledge.

### Attendance

I attended class every day except for one day when I was sick and two days when I attended Rocky Mountain Ruby Conference.

Bret & Travis & Rose & Mimi

#### Notes

* Got testing with Selenium working - very cool
* Site looks great.
* Implemented Stripe and Twilio as extensions

#### Scores

* Feature Completeness: 4: All features are correctly implemented along with two extensions
* Views: 3: Views make use of layout(s), partials and helpers, but some logic leaks through
* Controllers: 4: Controllers show significant effort to push logic down the stack
* Models: 3: Models show an effort to push logic down the stack, but need more internal refactoring
* Testing: 4: Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels
* Usability: 4: Project is highly usable and ready to deploy to customers
* Workflow: 4: Excellent use of branches, pull requests, and a project management tool.

#### Feedback from Travis

"Mimi is an industrious and extremely capable team member. Her ability for deciphering and picking apart complicated problems was a major asset on our team. Specifically, she is a refactoring guru and did wonders with some functional but very questionable methods I code vommitted into a create method in one of our controllers. She was very flexible over the course of the project and also very diligent with her workflow and being a team player when trying to resolve conflict within the group. I donâ€™t really have any areas for improvement for Mimi, I think she is well rounded and very capable. I would love to work on a project with Mimi again."

#### Playing a Part

I've participated in the larger Turing Community in the following ways:

* Attended Rocky Mountain Ruby Conference.
* Took over as co-organizer of Women Who Code Ruby Study Group at Turing.
* Helped 1508 students with Chisel and Enigma.
* Became a student representative for 1507.

## Review

### Notes

( Leave blanks for reviewers )

### Outcome

## A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations.

* 3: Student achieved a "3" or better on each category of the assessment

## B: Individual Work & Projects

A Turing student works to maximize their skill growth and demonstrates
that skill across a variety of work.

* 3: Student demonstrates commitment and growth in their work through satisfactory
evaluations of each project or a clearly upward-sloping trend.

## C: Group Work & Projects

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, and delivers a high-quality product.

* 4: Student consistently helps their teammates be their best selves, learn at
an accelerated pace, and achieve great results.

## D: Community Participation

A Turing student builds up the community around them by participating and
supporting other students, the larger Turing family, and persons outside our
walls who want to develop their own skills.

* 4: Student has a significant positive impact on the learning and spirit of the
people around them.

## E: Peer & Instructor Feedback

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.

* 3: Student consistently delivers meaningful feedback for peers and implements
strategies to improve themselves in response to feedback.
