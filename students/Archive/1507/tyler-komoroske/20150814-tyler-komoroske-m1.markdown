# Tyler Komoroske - Module 2 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

Prior to this module, I had no knowledge of development, or really anything technical.
My goals coming into Turing were to put as much time in as I possibly could and retain as much information as I could possibly learn. Throughout the module I made a continuous effort to make sure I was putting in the time and effort to be successful.

### End of Module Assessment

My progress through the module was assessed by Mike Dao and
here are the  
results:

## Scores

* Started with test.
* Began the test by creating teachers. Knew to hit the schema to find out what it required to create.
* Wrote tests in a way that order of creation of students would mess with display if not implemented correctly.
* Initially stored age as a string.
* Could follow error messages and how to solve them.
* used foreign key to link students to teacher.
* knew mystring was a result of fixtures.

I had a lot of fun working with Tyler on Traffic Spy.  He’s got a really solid foundation in Ruby, and he helped remove road blocks we ran into throughout the course of the project.  He’s a great teammate, and he kept our group work sessions fun and light.  I look forward to working with him again in the future.

### Feedback to me

Feedback from Ross:

Tyler was awesome during our little shop project. He was dedicated and motivated the entire time. His ideas were always helpful and insightful, and pushed the progress of the project even further. I think that in order to improve group workflow, Tyler could work on his own workflow process. At one point, there were several issues checked out on waffle under his name. I also encourage him to work on his keyboard shortcuts :smile: Overall, I would definitely enjoy working with Tyler in the future.

Feedback from Robbie:

Tyler was a joy to work with on this project. He has an awesome work ethic and put in the time and effort to deliver a polished product. Tyler has a solid understanding of rails and ruby and he was always willing to keep on working and keep the group on track. I look forward to working with Tyler again in the future.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

Ross Edfort:

Ross was a excellent partner to work with on little shop. He was a very hard worker and was consistently trying to stay ahead of the game in terms of deadlines. He was definitely committed to turing in an above average finished product. He also took constantly took initiative to implement features on his own. As for areas of improvement, sometimes I would say things and Ross did not acknowledge that I had even said anything. I think this was just a product of his own concentration, and he definitely was not intentionally ignoring me. This sort of make me feel stupid at times for mentioning my idea. Overall, Ross is great teammate and would definitely enjoy working with him again.
Jeff:

Pat Wey:

Pat really crushed this project. Since it was the first week in module 2, everything was extremely unfamiliar and the error messages did not make a whole lot of sense. Pat was able to troubleshoot these errors pretty consistently and kept us on track to meet deadlines. Pat was also an excellent teammate, and an awesome communicator.  It would be awesome to have an opportunity to work with him in the future.

Robbie Lane:

Robbie was an awesome teammate. He is extremely talented in all aspects of website development. Our project workflow was awesome, and there was essentially no stress throughout the entire project. Robbie constantly had solutions to almost every problem we ran into. The only area for improvement would be group communication. Sometimes I would mention a possible idea or solution, and I wouldn't get any feedback and that kind of made me feel like what I had suggested was stupid. I'm pretty sure that this was actually just a product of Robbie being really focused on whatever he had going on in his own head. I'm sure he was not just intentionally ignoring me, just something to be aware of in the future. Overall, Robbie was a great teammate and I would love to have an opportunity to work with him in the future.

### Playing a Part


* I helped hang two of the new TV's with Ross and Robbie
* I did the dished twice during this module
* I always try to keep things light and fun, which I think positively contribute to the
overall quality of life here at Turing.
* During this module, I defintely did not have a chance to be as involved as I would have liked to have been.
* I was always willing to help anyone with whatever they may have needed help with, but because I wasn't one of the stronger students in the cohort, people tended not to ask me for help.
* I always liked to ask my classmated how they were doing and if they needed help to let me know.
* I made an effort to come to Turing everyday with a smile on my face and take on every challenge with a positive attitude regardless of how overwhelmed I may have felt.
* I'm going to make an effort to be mre involved next module and help out in any way I can.


## Review

### Notes

* Comfort level with rails is pretty good right now
* Contact manager: Getting comfortable with MVC
* Getting a head start on issues would be helpful going forward. Dont be intimidated be higher skill levels in group.
