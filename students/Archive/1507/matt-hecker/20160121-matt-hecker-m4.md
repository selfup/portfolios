This module has been alot of off-road learning to me.

Alot of figuring out what I would enjoy working on. I had this idea at the start of the session that there was alot of wisdom in the idea of specializing in something ( a combination of stories from passionate programmer, podcast, youtubes. )

I turned this into an exercise in user experience. I wanted it to be as easy and intuitive to use as possible.

"but its just a crud app."

It still ended up being very educational!

* Is there really a reason to show the form to create a new idea while searching?

* Do we keep results filtered after search box loses focus?

* When do we go back to not filtering results?

on gametime it was about different ways to doing things programmatically
I completely redid parts of the project and learned afterwards that in those was employing purely declarative programming.

declarative programming is. (from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming))
a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow.

I had a whole bunch of moving objects with changing properties that followed specific rules, rather than having the logic dictate those properties and rules to the objects as the game progressed all the objects knew how they were supposed to interact from the outset and to animate the game I simply had to hand those objects to very few generic functions.

This was about Node for me. Im really intrigued by Node and its contrasting philosophy to rails (convention and all in one tool vs many small composable tools). I went into this project with a willful ignorance of how any Node frameworks worked. I wanted to see what it would take to emulate my favorite parts of rails in node.

* Made a sort of asset pipeline that only gets precompiled AFTER deploy to heroku (minus filename fingerprinting couldn't figure that out)

* made a logical require structure that kept socket and app settings as far away from the entry file as possible

* made controllers(routers) and figured out how to namespace those routers similar to rails controllers.

#### Community:
Previous modules have been about being in public (going to improv, doing student lead sessions). This module has been about getting comfortable talking one on one with people about anything in particular. I've paired with students in other cohorts and this cohort more freely this session and had fun doing so, usually as a follow up to the student lead sessions I did with Alon In the previous session(module 1 review).

# Feedback:
##  From Me:
#### Edgar:
Edgar is able to pick up on new concepts extremely fast. We paired on his personal project for a bit. I could make of a code snippet that explained a concept I was thinking about and he was able to adapt it to his code base right in front of me. He is really adaptable and I think he is going to to great in Turing going forward!

#### Travis:
I always notice your ability to subtly mediate a conversation during group retros and I appreciate it and I think its one of the reasons our group retros are so productive. I think its excellent that you try to bring out the best of people in this way.

poopsicle: That very same strength that mediates and mellows out conversations have, on very few and far between occasions, caused me to censor myself when in retrospect I probably should have spoken up a little bit.

#### Jack:
Jack Yeh, Was excellent to pair with. When we paired for some reason I was really nervous at the start. His demeanor and conversational style completely diffused that and Before long ideas were flowing freely and we were both having fun with the code.  I appreciate that he let me know when we were not on the same page but also reassuring me that we were on the same page. It boosted the confidence level and just made the whole experience much more interactive

#### Russel:
One of the things I like about Russell the most is that he is available. He constantly ask if I am available to go on a walk around the block. He is willing to let a conversation steer in any direction I choose. He is a good listener and open minded.

#### Lenny:
Lenny is both bright and humble. We paired for a bit on his headcount project and talked at length about the merits of staying behind for a module, and programming in general. I enjoy his enthusiasm for ideas just for the sake of ideas and found it refreshing to talk to him. Because of his humility and nature he is infinitely approachable. He relates any topic to ideas and contrasting viewpoints and so often causes conversations to elevate and turn more lofty even during  “water cooler” talk and it seems completely natural and not forced. I actually have no idea how he does this. I always end up enjoying where things go when he enters group  conversations at the lunch table. I also appreciate the fact that he seems to always be here working the extra hours needed to get a project done, even though Im not in his cohort and have never worked on project  long term with him.

## To Me:

#### Travis:
Matt has a heart of gold. Its clear that he always operates with a keen sense of wonder with regard to problem solving, and with best
intentions when interacting with classmates or group members. As a group member, Matt was always ready to share his knowledge with group
members, which was instrumental in developing my knowledge of HTTP, for instance. I think Matt can continue to focus on improving his
ability at empathizing with his partners mindset in social interactions to better develop his fluency with navigating the subtleties of
partner and group dynamics.

#### Gurusendesh:
feedback for Matt Hecker - I haven’t honestly spent a lot of time with Matt, but the few times that I have made me wish I was able to pick his brain a bit more. He was involved in one of the better student led sessions for us module 1’ers.  It was pretty amazing how he was able to get to the root of people’s issues, or explain what people were really trying to ask even if they weren’t able to vocalize it. He gave me a  great lunch hash session which changed the way I looked at hashes. Thanks!

#### Jack:
I had some preconceived notions about Matt before working with him. I expected him to be difficult to work with and just plow ahead without agreeing on an approach or thought process. I was pleasantly surprised that I was wrong. He could do better in understanding what the other person was trying to achieve earlier in the assignment. Working together it took us a little bit to get on the same page. Once we did I found that we were able to get the assignment done more quickly and with an iterative solution that was pretty elegant. Matt has mentioned that empathy is something he is working to improve. Matt is smart and is confident in his abilities but it can be a hinderance to his learning, as it exposes him to fewer approaches and solutions.  One exercise that he may find useful for his next collaborative project or assignment would be to let the other person drive and arrive at a solution that is based completely on the other person's approach.

#### Russel:
I made friends with Matt early on the in the module. He's smart, can talk about things that matter, and has interesting things to say. The only criticism I have is that he sometimes seems busy and uninvested in friendship. Matt is conscientious, so I'm not worried about Matt's self-improvement. It still would have been nice to have seen him at improv more.




#### Going Forward:
Looking forward to sort of stepping up my paper game (resume, personal website, cover letters) with the free time. Also looking to start more conversation with potential employers.

I've sorted decided that I prefer a Node job. Optimistic about getting a Node job!
