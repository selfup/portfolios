# Matt Hecker - M2 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

Soft skills Team Work

### End of Module Assessment
Instructor - Andrew

Challenge - Users

Notes -

Matt did well with a hard challenge. He was on top of every step of the process. He was good at explaining what he was doing, thought as he pointed out he did go quickly which causes problems in groups. I was overall impressed with his knowledge and use of rails, active record and ruby.

## Community

###  Feedback
#### Bad:
  "Communication is tough and it does not come easy. I find it hard to complete my sentences and many attempts to provide direct feedback are overcomplicated."

 "While sometimes his explanations of ideas and drive to implement something can get in the way of communicating clearly to his group members before taking action"


  Communication is an issue with me:

  I knew this coming in and I do think I'm getting better at it but still a ways to go
#### things I'm doing or have done to work on this
  * taking notes (doesn't always work can get annoying to the other person)
  * saving questions for later
  * going to improv

#### things I'm going to start doing
  * going to more improv
  * before I ask for information that I want to know, I need to ask an open ended question about what was said to me
  * just calming down
  * caring less about the programming more about the people

#### Good:

  "very receptive to feedback. Example, when I would bring something to your attention, you would really try and understand. I have not seen this effort to understand in any other co-student."

  "he was very receptive to feedback and adapting his working style to better accommodate his group."

  " He was organized, structured and on top of this project from start to finish.  He has a gentle way of leading which is very easy to follow but not to suggest he is weak in any way."

### Playing a Part

  * done a little pairing with 1508.
  * have made an effort to unclog toilets that I did not clog myself (Horace may have helped)
  * bring coffee/candy in for cohort

## Review

### Outcome

## A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations.

* 4: Student achieved two or more "4s" on the assessment

## B: Individual Work & Projects

A Turing student works to maximize their skill growth and demonstrates
that skill across a variety of work.


* 3: Student demonstrates commitment and growth in their work through satisfactory
evaluations of each project or a clearly upward-sloping trend.

## C: Group Work & Projects

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, and delivers a high-quality product.

* 3: Student fully participates in their group work to facilitate group harmony
while achieving consistently satisfactory results.

## D: Community Participation

A Turing student builds up the community around them by participating and
supporting other students, the larger Turing family, and persons outside our
walls who want to develop their own skills.

* 3: Student participates in required activities and does at least one or two
above-and-beyond supports of the community.

## E: Peer & Instructor Feedback

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.

* 3: Student consistently delivers meaningful feedback for peers and implements
strategies to improve themselves in response to feedback.
