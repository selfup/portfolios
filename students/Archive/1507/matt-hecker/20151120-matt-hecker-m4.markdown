## Community

###  Feedback
  getting feedback was difficult this module because more of our projects were solo and the feedback I have gotten back from the feedback app has been a little bit canned. For this reason Im including some of the most helpful feedback I've gotten even if it was from other modules as it pertains to  things I've been working on over the course of several modules.

#### Bad:

  * from last module (2)

    "Communication is tough and it does not come easy. I find it hard to complete my sentences and many attempts to provide direct feedback are overcomplicated."

   "While sometimes his explanations of ideas and drive to implement something can get in the way of communicating clearly to his group members before taking action"


  Communication is still an issue but its getting much smaller!


#### things I'm doing or have done to work on this(this module[3])

  * taking notes (doesn't always work can get annoying to the other person)
  * Went to every improv except one
  * writing my ideas privately and reading them to make sure I can articulate them  before bringing them to people. (when working with a boss or project manager)
  * before I ask for information that I want to know, I  ask an open ended question about what was said to me
  * seeking out group project for individual project

#### things I'm going to start doing
  * writing publicly (blog)
  * pairing with people on subjects or technology Im not familiar with at all
  (listening skills, filtering questions)

#### Good:

  If Im going to include the all the good (bad) feedback I got from last module then I should be fair and include some of the positive feedback I've gotten from that module as well.

  last module (2)
  "very receptive to feedback. Example, when I would bring something to your attention, you would really try and understand. I have not seen this effort to understand in any other co-student."

  this module (3)
  "Well you seem to be communication just fine with me right now."
  (this seems to be a recurring message)(need to stop psyching myself out)

### Playing a Part

  * Student lead session all module long (module 1 review)
  * lightning talk (pry neato's)
  * pairing with 1510 students some
