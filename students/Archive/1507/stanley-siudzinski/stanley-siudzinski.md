# Stanley Siudzinski - Module 3 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

  This module ended a 6 month break from school. I faced technical and
  soft challenges because of my absence, and handled them to the best of
  my ability to achieve above average results. I have gained much knowledge
  out of this module, and feel more sure than ever that I can provide
  real problem solving skills in a technology environment.


### End of Module Assessment

My progress through the module was assessed by           and here are the
results:

* Satisfactory progress
* Ruby stynax and style
* Rails style and api
* Testing
* User interface

### Attendance

I was present for 100% class this module.

### Projects

I completed the following individual project for this module:

#### APIcurious (HapiPics)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/SSgoldwater/hapipics)

    This was a four day project where I built a small instragram feed replica.
  On the backend, I consumed the Instagram API as well as utilizing its OAuth
  integration. The interface is clean and I enjoyed learning and utilizing my
  first JQuery, as well as honing my HTML and CSS skills. My project was
  evaluated by Josh Mejia with the following results:

  * Features: 4
  * Interface: 4
  * Test-Driven Development: 4
  * Server-Side Application and APIs: 3

##### Takeaway

  * APIs are powerful and abundant
  * JQuery, HTML, and CSS are the frontend trifecta

#### RailsEngine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/SSgoldwater/railsengine)

    This four day project involved turning a large sales engine dataset into an
  API server. I sucessfully parsed CSV data into an SQL database, and optimized
  retreval by utilizing active record queries. I failed to complete business
  intelligence queries, and spent time looking into SQL queries instead of
  writing ruby code to get the tests passing. In a live production situation, I
  would have chosen to complete the product. My project was evaluated by Jorge
  and recieved the following results:

  * Completion: 1: Project fails more than 10 spec harness tests.
  * Test-Driven Development: 1: Project does not have 70% test coverage.
  * Code Quality: 3: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.
  * API Design: 3: Project uses strong and consistent data formats throughout, while relying mostly on standard Rails JSON features.
  * Queries: 4: Project makes great use of ActiveRecord relationships and queries, including some advanced query functionality such as joins and includes.

##### Takeaway

  * ActiveRecord queries are much more performant than ruby code
  * Big Data is awesome
  * I would like to know SQL in depth

#### Self-Directed (MyCarPlease)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/SSgoldwater/railsengine)

    This was a two week project of our choice as the student. I build a valet
  parking application that requires communication between a native mobile valet
  app, and a rails api customer web interface.  I built the mobile app with
  Adobe PhoneGap utilizing a single page application and vanilla JQuery. This
  project is a demonstration of my ability and desire to learn new technologies.
  My project was evaluated by Josh Mejia and recieved the following results:

  "Bugs in production but worked locally. If they get fixed, bump completion to 4. Really strong project even though there's a 2."

  * Completion: 4
  * Organization: 4: Developer used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.
  * Test-Driven Development: 4: Project shows exceptional use of testing at different layers (above 95% coverage).
  * Code Quality: 3: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.
  * User Experience: 3: Project exhibits a production-ready user experience.
  * Performance: 3: Project pages load on average under 400 milliseconds.

##### Takeaway

  * New technologies drive me
  * Much JQuery was written
  * PhoneGap creates abnormal development implications
  * The pain of having an app fail on launch

## Team

### Projects

  I participated in the following team projects:

#### The Pivot (GitHired)

  * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jphoenix86/the_pivot)

    This was a two week team project with two other developers. We implemented
  a GitHub Oauth authorization to give developers and companies a place to
  communicate and apply for jobs. We provided a custom resume maker, job
  category filters, and dashboards with feeds for both job seekers and
  businesses. The project was evaluated by Josh Mejia and recieved the following
  results:

  * "Solid project with good code quality."
  * "Implemented OAuth with Github"
  * "Solid testing with the exception of OAuth related requests"

  Scores:

  * Completion: 4
  * Organization: 4
  * Progress: 3
  * Test-Driven Development: 3
  * Code Quality: 3
  * User Experience: 3


##### My Contribution

    Mostly all of the development was done in pairs or groups, and on my own
  I was assigned an array of tasks in all areas.

##### Takeaway

  * Inheriting code teaches you to write it better from the start
  * Pair programming is highly effective

## Community

### Giving Feedback

  According to the Feedback application:

  * I delivered 100% of the requested feedback

### Playing a Part

    This module took its toll mentally due to my gap in modules.  I regret not
  being able to participate more, and now that I feel caught up technically,
  am ready and eager to give myself back to the community.

  * A: End-of-Module Assessment: 4
  * B: Individual Work & Projects: 3
  * C: Group Work & Projects: 3
  * D: Community Participation: 3
  * E: Peer & Instructor Feedback: 3
