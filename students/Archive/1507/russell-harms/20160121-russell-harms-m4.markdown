### Your Mission

During my final module a Turing my goal was to learn what I need to about the job hunting process. Since this is my first time finding a job, it's easy to be intimidated. I'm excited by the prospect of entering the real world.

This project was our introduction to AJAX calls and no-refresh javascript behavior. It harkened back to single day module 1 projects. It was essentially a tutorial. I don't have much to say about it.

This may be my favorite project that I've done in all of Turing. Learning the principles of object oriented javascript was very cool. I feel like the code is very clean in this project.

When I started this project I decided to go a bit harder on myself and implement an alternative voting algorithm. About half way through I figured I bit off more than I could chew, but it worked out in the end. Like most of module 4, I feel like I might have implemented things differently if I did it again. The learning experience is very valuable.

### Getting Feedback

Deborah Hamel: Russell took the time to help me practice TDD from a blank page even though he had his own work to do. This helped me enormously. Things that are really hard for me right now, come so easy to him. Getting to know him has also been an unexpected surprise. We are so different, yet Turing let us cross paths and I truly appreciate the chance to see the world through his lens.  I hope he stays open to people like me getting to know him better.

MB Burch: I learned so much from working on Game Time with you. I have to admit, I went in a little skeptical after working together on Little Shop (and maybe you did, too), but I‚Äôm proud of what we built. Working with you encouraged me to branch out from my typical style and try things in a new way, which I really needed. I liked feeling a little unsure of where we were headed at times, and all the crazy stuff we did with using time helped me immensely in other projects. I felt like you were a more patient explainer this time around, and I really enjoyed working with you. Even though it seemed hard sometimes when you just wanted to do your own thing and run with it, you pushed yourself to be a clear communicator and work on things together. My biggest piece of advice would be time management and DTR stuff. Sometimes I was caught off guard when you would just leave, or when you needed to work on your lightning talk during the day. I sometimes felt abandoned, but we totally pulled it together and I shouldn‚Äôt have worried. I think as long as we both take more time with partners in the future to set clear expectations, things will work out fine.

### Giving Feedback

Matt Hecker: I made friends with Matt early on the in the module. He's smart, can talk about things that matter, and has interesting things to say. The only criticism I have is that he sometimes seems busy and uninvested in friendship. Matt is conscientious, so I'm not worried about Matt's self-improvement. It still would have been nice to see him at improv more.

MB Burch: Being a homeschooled shut-in, one of my main goals for attending turing was getting better at working on a team. You're one of the people I've been paired with on multiple projects. It's a good experience because it lets us see how our team-working ability improves over time, and I feel like this was definitely the case working with you. Things were a bit ugly on our first project, and you were very supportive and instructional to my trying to be a better team member. I remember that my feedback from last project was about how much you worried, and I didn't feel that at all this project. This was the most productive team experience I've had, and I think it's largely due to us figuring out how to work better with each other. I'm not sure what criticism to give, just keep working on nervousness I suppose. I think you'll do fine. üëç
