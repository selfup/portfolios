### Your Mission

Turing is my first experience in something approximating the real world. I knew that I could "write code" before turing, but I came here to experience school, meeting people with a different perspective, and coding with people I don't know.

Challenge: Top Plays

Notes:

* Felt comfortable in most aspects
* Could've slowed down and I think that would've helped him calm down

1. Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking
4: Developer independently breaks complex processes into logical sequences of small steps and validates progress along the way

2. Ruby Syntax & Standard Library
4: Developer is able to comfortably implement solutions using the best-choice tools Ruby has to offer

3. Rails Syntax & API
3: Developer is able to utilize Rails methods and structures, but needs some direct guidance

4. Rails Style
3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack

5. Testing
3: Developer uses tests at multiple layers of abstraction to drive development

6. Collaboration
3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process

### Attendance

I did not miss any days of school this module.

### Work

This module has been very busy and I've been annoyed with how little extracurricular things I've gotten done.

I discussed with Josh Cheek a plan I have to build a programming language, and he introduced me to some machine grammar tools in Ruby which I spent many hours playing with on my own. I also attended Josh's “book club” in which he and some other students are building a Ruby parser. I hope to work on this more in the future.

I went to lunch with Josh from Github and talked about security, internet politics, and programming cultures. I also attended a “DeRailed” Rails user's group meetup (although was not too enthralled). On a more personal side, I attended a “Less Wrong” meetup early in the month, and met some cool people including a member of the Magic the Gathering hall of fame.

Overall this module has been very hard, as advertized. I've yet to have the experience of being in a group feeling benefitial to me. I want to believe it is, and I suspect that there may be something I'm doing which makes it difficult, but I haven't figured out what it is. I'm bothered that I can't seem to learn one of the things I came to turing to learn, and I'm frustrated that it looks like I'll enter the work environment without learning it.

#### Traffic Spy

* [Github URL](https://github.com/roseak/traffic_spy)
* [Original Assignment](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/traffic_spy.html)

I learned some cool git workflow stuff from George in Sales Engine, and as a result I was pretty active about git management in this project, which was useful as this was a four-person project and merge conflicts came up a lot. I learned a lot about how important workflow is, as it helped me churn out a lot of the grunt work by the time my teammates finished new functionality.

There was a bit of a gap, but I was impressed with my teammates' assertiveness when it came to asking questions, which is something I missed in my later project.

Evaluated by Josh M.

There were no comments for this evaluation.

Functional Expectations: 3
Test-Driven Development: 4
Encapsulation / Components: 3
Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
Sinatra / Web and Business Logic: 3

I didn't get any group feedback for this project. In our mini-retro my three traits were Workflow, Optimism, and Being unemotional.

#### Little Shop of Orders

Working on a team was definitely more challenging on this project than the last, but coming out with a real finished project was much more rewarding. I have more to learn about being on a team, and "leading" in particular. I could sense our team growing as time went on, but I feel like there was still something missing, and the project still wasn't as good as it could have been. I was really happy about our workflow.

We received the following feedback and scores:

Evaluated by Mike

* Good use of jQuery.
* Some user flow could be better, needs some UX enhancements on the admin dashboard side.
* 60 tests
* 100% test coverage
* Well written tests
* Feature Completeness: 3
* Views: 3
* Controllers: 3
* Models: 4
* Testing: 4
* Usability: 3
* Workflow: 4

### Giving Feedback

Rose – I think our team was a bit stacked against you, but you proved to be great at wrangling it. I think we have different learning styles, which I personally found it a bit tough to deal with, but that can't really be helped. You kick ass at DTR, which is all that can be asked in that situation. I'm a bit jealous of your assertiveness. I have no doubt I'll see in you in module 3.

Ryan - When I think of who I consider the strongest students at the school, I think it's the students who can best resist negativity. “Hype” is a real thing, which you do very well, and it benefits your team. As your friend I'm obviously biased, but you're easy to pair with, and a good programmer. You're probably on my turing dream team.

Matt E. - You're quiet, but can definitely be trusted to get the work done. I don't know if it's just conflicting personality types, but it seemed like you were a bit impatient to get to work when I wanted to have deeper conversations about the project. There's no question you pulled your weight. I'm sure the project was over faster because you were on our team.

MB - It was cool to be on a team with you since we didn't really "hang out" any before this project. I always enjoyed that you understood math-speak. Maybe it's just my personality type, but I find myself wishing you were a bit more assertive. It seems like you reserve your suggestions until too late and they becomes complaints, but I thought everything you had to say was valuable. I guess I should also work to come off as less intimidating. You definitely worked hard and did your part on the team. I'm interested to see what you do when you get out of turing.

Jeff R. - You are super easy to be friends with. This won't come as a surprise to anyone for me to say, but you are very soft-spoken. It's a bit hard to get opinions out of you, but I thought everything you said was valuable. (Our whole team seems to have that trait.) It is cool to work with you, because it's fun to see you get excited about things. I think you should try not to worry as much. I'm happy that you're in my module. You definitely did your share of the work.

Chris - You stike me as a very hard worker. It was fun to be the leader of the project because I could just tell you to do things and you'd have them done, sometimes at 2am. I remember you saying at the end of last module that you didn't expect to enjoy this module, so you won't be surprised that I don't think this kind of work pushed you to your potential. It might benefit you to try being a team leader on the next project. You were an asset to the team.

### Being a Community Member

Jeff R. - You're great to work with, you're obviously very strong with coding in general, but you already know that. I know we all kind of teased you about it, but I appreciate all you taught our group about git workflow. It was really valuable, and I think we'll all be able to take that with us to future projects and teams. The criticism I would offer you is that you're not especially communicative while you're in the zone and working on something, so that made pairing difficult, but you already know that. That wasn't all the time, but happened a couple times over the course of the project. Anyway, I enjoyed being in a group with you, and I'm really glad to have gotten to know you over the course of the last couple weeks.

MB - I learned some good stuff from you, particularly around refactoring, that I hope to apply to future projects, so thanks for taking the time to explain your thought process when I asked. It seemed to be hard for you sometimes to be a part of a group, as the appearance was that you’d rather be working on your own. You know a ton, and are really good at this, but I’d encourage you to slow down sometimes and make sure you’re not making little mistakes. You mentioned in your feedback to me that you’d try to be less intimidating. I didn’t find you intimidating at all, which I think is good, but I did find you to be a bit unavailable during the project and seemingly less invested in the last couple days than the rest of us were. Even if this was done with the intent of letting us learn (and I appreciate that!), make sure you’re keeping open communication with your group, especially as a leader. I’m so excited to see what you are able to do with all the individual work in mod 3, and I hope you’re open to me asking you for help, because I think I still have a lot to learn from you! Oh… and thanks for the honest feedback on the complaint thing. I’m working on that, and my confidence when I am with people who know more than me. I appreciate it, and keep reminding me if you see me doing it, okay?

### Playing a Part

After my portfolio review last module I did a student elective on Bitcoin. I founded a cryptography club, which had one meeting to overview basic cryptography concepts. We visited the denver Bitcoin center and met some people there working on bitcoin-related projects. Next module I plan to start earlier so there's less work in the way. I've already started on doing a bit of work with Horace on next module's DSA covering cryptography.
