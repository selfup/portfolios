# Russell Harms - M3 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

This module I wanted to focus on soft skills. I went a lot of
improv and meditation. I felt pretty down this module, and
tried to spend a lot of time on self-care.

### Feedback to Me

**Bret** - Russell was a pleasure to work with. He was hardworking. One area of improvement would be to communicate a little better on what he was working on. Otherwise he was a pleasure to work with. I would pair with him again.

**Matt E.** - I enjoyed working with Russell on The Pivot. We started with his team's base, which I thought was in pretty good shape. The project was easily the best team experience I've had here. I felt we all pitched in and coordinated our efforts well-- and this of course includes Russell. The experience couldn't have come at a better time for me as I was pretty worn down. Russell brings a lot to this cohort and it is fun to watch him grow as a person.

### Feedback From Me

**Bret** - Bret is a good person to work with. Given how well he did on the frontend of his last project, I was hoping it would rub off on me. Unfortunately he just spent the whole time criticizing the frontend work I did for the project we inherited. Feedback is hard to give because it seems like the eaiser people are to work with, the less I have to say at the end... I really don't have any criticisms for bret.

**Matt E.** - Having worked with Matt on Traffic Spy, I can't say much has changed. He's the kind of person who just wants to sit down and get shit done. His approach to the project is to divide and conquer, which was a nice change from Little Shop. He works hard, and was good to have on the team. The only criticism I have is that he can sometimes be a bit on edge.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

According to the Feedback application:

* I delivered 100% of the requested feedback
* 96% of those submissions were approved and delivered
* 84% of my submissions were meaningful to the recipient

### Playing a Part

**George** - Russell volunteered to lead the Kids Who Code meet up when I needed someone to step when I was out of town for a weekend. Beyond this, he planned out a detailed lesson for the session. I heard many good reviews from the parents afterward. On another occasion, Russell led half the class on an “advanced” track to go over some physics design for those that were interested. His lesson was in-depth and showed that Russell took time to learn Scratch enough to employ some of the more complex functions.

* I instructed at 3 kids-who-code groups.
* I gave a student lead session on Bitcoin at the beginning of the module.
