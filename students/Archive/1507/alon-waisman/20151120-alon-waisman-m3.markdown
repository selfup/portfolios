# Alon Waisman - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

After Module 2, I felt like I had a basic understanding of Rails, but I also knew that a lot of it hadn't soaked in properly - managing a Rails environment hadn't become 'instinctive' as I wanted it to be. I wanted to get to that point in Module 3. Of course, there's still plenty of room to grow, but I've become significantly more comfortable working in this environment.

## Attendance

I attended on all days of class, but I did have to come in late once for a doctor's appointment, and I left early missing almost an entire Friday in order to take care of my sick son.

## Individual Projects

### APIcurious

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/MowAlon/twitter_bootleg)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/apicurious.markdown)
* [Deployed App](https://mowalons-twitter-bootleg.herokuapp.com)

#### Description

* Learn to consume data from third-party APIs
* Continue to emphasize performance, UI, and overall user experience
* Continue using TDD to drive all layers of development
* Coordinate with project stakeholders to produce quality code and product

In this project, we focused on consuming and working with data from public APIs. As a vehicle for learning these concepts, we selected an API from a popular website and worked to re-construct a simplified version of the website's existing UI using our own API.

As we built these features, we also worked with the OAuth protocol to authenticate our users with the third-party provider. We also used various testing techniques to allow us to test against the third-party data.

My project recreates Twitter with most major functionality intact.

Completed individually over a period of 4 days.

You haven't forgotten about your old friend SalesEngine, have you? That's ok if you have, since this project will re-acquaint you!

In this project, we'll use Rails and ActiveRecord to build a JSON API which exposes the SalesEngine data schema.

## Feedback to Me

### From Emily Blanchard
"Alon Waisman is that amazing combination of  brilliant brain and kind human. Everyone at Turing is busy most of the time, but Mr. Waisman spent some of the preciousness helping the class of 1510. He co-ran weekly ruby Q and A session with Matt H.. In addition, he worked people into his schedule to help with daunting projects. On a more personal note: I was lost in the coding portion of Enigma, even tho the problem solving part was in my head. Alon told me he did not want to hurt my feelings, but that I was behind. This one was already judging herself too harshly, so it was taken out of context. I was upset with myself for not being able to stuff more things into my already loaded brain.  A little time needed to pass for me to choose the right words to slack to Alon. His reaction was caring, apologetic (although it did not need to be), and full of wit (as usual). Once this went down,  the relationship was better than ever. I look forward to working with Alon again, whatever the capacity, or just time to hang out with “Superman” (no matter the outfit). Turing made a great move getting this guy."

### From Justin Pease
"Alon is always looking to help other people.  During my time off/self study he has acted as a client walking me through a project I am building for him.  This project is what I feel has taught me the most during the last six weeks.   He has been very available to help me if I get stuck and I am very glad he came to me with this idea."

## Community

### Playing a Part

* **Week 1**: Developed and led a session for students new to the program - [System Setup Tricks](https://gist.github.com/MowAlon/1641b1208aba11a15d85)
* **Weeks 2, 3, 5**: Led weekly sessions of Ruby review for Module 1 students. I always thought something like this would be a good idea for the newcomers who felt like they needed some additional assistance to reinforcement, so I put it together and got help from Matt Hecker. I'd like to do it again next module.
