## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

Attitude (see Feedback section below).

### End of Module Assessment

Assessed By: Tess Challenge: Highest Scoring Word

##### Notes

* For the most part was solid save for a few speed bumps. Once I pointed out the speed bumps he comfortably worked through them.

1. Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking - 4
... Developer independently breaks complex processes into logical sequences of small steps and validates progress along the way
2. Ruby Syntax & Standard Library - 3
... Developer is able to comfortably implement solutions in Ruby
3. Rails Syntax & API - 4
... Developer is able to smoothly utilize Rails methods and structures with a minimum of debugging or support
4. Testing - 3
... Developer uses tests at multiple layers of abstraction to drive development
5. Workflow - 4
... Developer is a master of their tools, efficiently moving between phases of development
6. Collaboration - 3
... Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process

### Attendance

I attended every day, but I did leave early twice. Once, I was sick, and we
didn't have anything going on after lunch, so I left skipped out to avoid
additional exposure to everyone else. The other day, I left early to
get my cast and pin removed.

## Work

### Homework Projects

Module 2 involves a lot of tutorials and homework assignments rather than many
evaluated projects. Some of the homework assignments are listed below. They
covered increasingly detailed elements of Rails development, like web-based data
submission, user authentication, authorization, etc. One example is below.

Assessor: Mike

##### Notes

* It actually tells me dad jokes.
* Cannot update items [Editor's note: I fixed the bug shortly after assessment.]
* Cannot upload images for new items.
* You can apply any joke to any item.
* 127 tests
* 97.5 percent coverage
* Some opportunity to clean controllers
* Minor places where some logic could be pushed down or out.

1. Feature Completeness - 2
... There are one or two features missing or incorrectly implemented
2. Views - 4
... Views show logical refactoring into layout(s), partials and helpers, with no logic present
3. Controllers - 3
... Controllers are generally well organized with three or fewer particularly ugly parts
4. Models - 4
... Models show excellent organization, refactoring, and appropriate use of Rails features
5. Testing - 3
â€‹... Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features
6. Usability - 3
... Project is highly usable, but needs more polish before it'd be customer-ready
7. Workflow - 3
... Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.

### Feedback to Me

I was advised early on in this module that I'd made comments that
offended or upset others at Turing. Although none of the things I said were
inentionally malicious, I learned that some of my off-hand comments and
seemingly (to me) innocuous statements hurt others around me.

As a result, aside from the class material I've been learning, my prime focus
has been to adjust how I interact with others. In the short term, that meant
taking some simple steps, like wearing a bracelet as a simple reminder that I
had something to be conscious of and sitting in the back of the room (which
helps reduce my 'joke' commentary in class). In other words, I'm trying to talk
less.

Of course, I'm also more conscious of the impact of my words in general. I'm
trying to proactively address possible negative reactions as they happen if I'm
at all able to identify them. I think this has helped those around me understand
that I don't mean to be rude, even if I am accidentally. It doesn't solve the
problem, but it helps with the relationships I have.

More importantly, I contacted each person in my cohort individually to explain
that I'd been made aware of the issue and that it was something I wanted to
work on. I asked them for help identifying if and when I say or do something
that upsets them, and I asked for candid feedback based on our past
interactions. Most said there weren't any issues, but I got very real
feedback from some, and I've done my best to internalize it.

Since contacting the cohort, I've been checked by one or two classmates for
what I believe were minor issues, and I haven't been notified directly or
indirectly of any bigger concerns. I think this means I'm doing better, and
I'll continue to work on myself to be a better example than I have been.

-----

* Also, a teammate on a recent project sent me this feedback:

"Alon is a great guy. I think he is often misunderstood. He is always looking
to help other people who are struggling. He constantly brings in snacks to
share with people which shows he is actively looking to give others. He is a
very strong problem solver and was fun working with on our last project. I was
struggling to keep up but he constantly came to me and walked me through the
learning. Thanks for that!"

## Community

### Playing a Part

* On Friday, September 4, I delivered a lightning talk on CRISPR, a new genetic engineering platform that's pretty incredible.
* I've been baking cookies like a mad man, trying to feed the folks working here over the weekend while I work with my team.

As for more real interactions in the community, I don't feel like I've been
active in the community this module. This is partly because the personal
reflection discussed above includes having fewer interactions with others.
Beyond that, though, a lot of the way I work with others is to help them with
their projects. In module 2, I'm not nearly as 'ahead of the curve' as I was in
module 1, so I feel less able to assist others.

I did, however, try to help in at least a few instances, especially with the new
1508 class because I'm more comfortable with the material they covered.

One of my goals going into this module was to attend local meetups, but I did
not... partly because I felt I needed to better understand my personality
issues before introducing myself to more of the community, but also because
the workload this module was high and I have obligations at home with my
family. Attending local meetups continues to be a goal as I plan for the
next module.


## A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations.

* 4: Student achieved two or more "4s" on the assessment

## B: Individual Work & Projects

A Turing student works to maximize their skill growth and demonstrates
that skill across a variety of work.

* 3: Student demonstrates commitment and growth in their work through satisfactory
evaluations of each project or a clearly upward-sloping trend.

## C: Group Work & Projects

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, and delivers a high-quality product.

* 3: Student fully participates in their group work to facilitate group harmony
while achieving consistently satisfactory results.

## D: Community Participation

A Turing student builds up the community around them by participating and
supporting other students, the larger Turing family, and persons outside our
walls who want to develop their own skills.

* 3: Student participates in required activities and does at least one or two
above-and-beyond supports of the community.

## E: Peer & Instructor Feedback

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.

* 3: Student consistently delivers meaningful feedback for peers and implements
strategies to improve themselves in response to feedback.
