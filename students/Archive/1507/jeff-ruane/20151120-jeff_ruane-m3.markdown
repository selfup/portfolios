### Your Mission

Coming into Module 3, I think my biggest concern is simply keeping up with the workload. I know this module is difficult, and I really don't want to fall behind at any point. Last module, I don't think I put as much effort into a lot of the individual, ungraded assignments as I should have, and I don't want to make that mistake again. Over the break, I think I've gotten some much needed perspective, and realized that this whole program is only 7 months, and I'm already halfway through it, and there's really no excuse to not put in as much effort as possible while I'm here. So, my goal for this module is to work as hard as possible, and not be as easily distracted by friends who want to go have fun. The effort that I put in now will directly effect where I am in a couple months when I'm searching for a job.

I think I did a much better job as far as contributing to the community last module, and I'd like to keep that up. In general, I just want to make myself available to module 1 and 2 students, while still not being pushy. I don't like the idea of offering help if I haven't been asked, because the struggle of trying to figure out a problem is so valuable, but I'd like for other students to know that I'm always willing to help if I can. I also want to keep going strong with Kids Who Code. It has been a really valuable experience so far, both for me and for the kids (from what their parents have been telling me), so I'd like to keep helping with that as much as possible. Also, I've noticed that the people volunteering to help are all module 3 and 4 students, so I'd really like to encourage some module 1 and 2 students to help out so that hopefully Kids Who Code can be sustained after we leave Turing.

Aside from that, I still have a lot of the same goals as last module. I want to keep learning other skills when I have time, and I still think that shell scripting is a good place to put that effort into. I also want to keep pursuing other passions, specifically photography.

### Work

I had two week long individual projects this module:

#### Apicurious

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jbrr/apicurious)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/apicurious.md#technical-expectations)
* [Heroku Deployment](https://jbrr-apicurious.herokuapp.com)

In this project, I started learning how to work with APIs by building a Twitter clone. I was evaluated by Jorge and recieved the following scores:

##### Evaluation Scores

* Completion: 3
* Organization: 4
* TDD: 4
* Code Quality: 4
* UX: 3

#### Rales Engine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jbrr/rales-engine)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/rails_engine.md)

In this project, I built Sales Engine using ActiveRecord, and exposing API endpoints of all the queries. I was evaluated by Jorge and recieved the following scores:

##### Evaluation Scores

* Completion: 3
* TDD: 4
* Code Quality: 3.5
* API Design: 4
* Queries: 3

## Team

### Projects

I had two team projects this module, one with Rose and Regis, and the other with Chris:

#### The Pivot (Earforked)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jbrr/the_pivot)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/the_pivot.md)
* [Heroku Deployment](https://earforked.herokuapp.com)

In this project, we took [Rose's codebase](https://github.com/TeamConchord/Earmarked) from last module's *Little Shop of Orders* and extended on it. We added admin functionality, more stats to track donations, and more. I was on a team with Regis and Rose. We were evaluated by Mike:

##### Evaluation Comments


* Twilio verify phone number on login.
* there are charts and graphs and progress bars.
* No paperclip.
* 96.23 percent coverage
* 100 tests.
* Some opportunities to refactor, perhaps look at decorators.
* Some sweet graphs
* last tweet from candidate
* Amazing hero image. <3


##### Evaluation Scores

* Feature Completeness: 4
* Organization: 3
* Progress: 4
* TDD: 3
* Code Quality: 3
* UX: 4

##### Feedback

from Rose:

"Working with you was nothing but positive.  Your ability to stay calm and the amazing flow our group had made this hands down my favorite group experience.  The points when I wasn’t sure what to you, you’d be able to step in and throw down some know-how that would keep the group moving along.  You were always up to try something new, and I couldn’t be happier with how it all turned out."

from Regis:

"Was the best team lead I have had yet. He was not aggressive, and was not too laid back. He let the team work on their ideas and gave mini deadlines to be sure we weren’t getting lost. He really helped improve my experience at Turing. I never felt pushed, and he was also reassuring. The only poopsicle I can think of for Jeff is that he might be too laid back but other than that he has a really good head on his shoulders."

#### School Sync

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Schoolrunner/tssd-1507-a) (Private Repository)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/self_directed_project.md)
* [Schoolrunner User Stories (project A)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cOphM8Wqt15RL06gbKcf7S88B6nAXc2VGkyN2zPlaxg/edit#heading=h.j51wpgcw56ru)
* Heroku Deployment: Unfortunately, due to student privacy concerns, this project was not put into production.

In this project, Chris and I teamed up to make a simple app for Schoolrunner. Schoolrunner allows schools to sync data with their servers, and our app was for schools to have some peace of mind that their syncs were successful and their data is safe. It involved hitting one API and displaying the data in a human readable way. Building this project with Rails would not have been very challenging, so we decided to build it in AngularJS in hopes that it would be integrated with Schoolrunner's existing infrastructure. We were evaluated by Jorge with the following scores:

##### Evaluation Scores

* Completion: 4
* Organization: 4
* TDD: 4
* Code Quality: 4
* UX: 3.5
* Performance: 3

##### Feedback

"The Project was awesome! You really figured out some key components to get this project started including how to make the api call in the factory.  You have a lot of patience for looking at documentation and figuring out how to implement different functionality. I know I definitely could not have done this project on my own!"

## Community

### Feedback from Peers

* Dmitry Vizersky - "You’ve been an awesome posse member. You have a very clear problem solving process and I liked pairing with you during morning warmups. You’re very curious to learn more and really dig into the details of code. keep up the great work!"

### Playing a Part

* On October 10, I helped teach the Kids Who Code class.
* On October 16, I held a student led session with Alon and Ross to help module 1 students make bash aliases and customize Atom.
* On November 5, I got a student shoutout from MB for helping with CSV parsing in Rales Engine.
* On November 18, I attended the Derailed meetup and repped Turing pretty hard.
