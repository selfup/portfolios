#Jeff Ruane - M2 Portfolio

##Individual

###Areas of Emphasis
Coming into this module, I want to do more to be an active member of the community.
I gave myself an excuse last module that I'm pretty reserved until I'm comfortable
in a new place, but I won't have that excuse to fall on this module. I'm not sure
yet what this will include, it might be running a student led session some Friday
if I can think of anything that I could teach that might be valuable. It might
also include just sticking around longer after class to offer help if I can.

I also want to keep practicing Ruby. I think I'm somewhat proficient, but there
is so much room for improvement, and I want to keep working on those skills.
Obviously, I also want to get the most I can out of the new material we'll be
covering, and I'm excited to be introduced to Rails.

I would also like to start an outside project. My idea for now is to
learn more about shell scripting. I got a book on it, an old book of my dad's,
*The Unix Programming Environment*. He also gave me a book that Dennis Ritchie
wrote, *The C Programming Language*, but learning C seems a little overwhelming
considering the other work I'll be expected to keep up on.

Finally, I want to keep old passions alive. I used to love photography, and I've
gotten out of it lately, but I'd like to start working on that again when I have
time. I think it's important to have other hobbies and passions outside of
computing, and technology in general.

###End of Module Assessment

I was assessed by Andrew:

####Scores

1. Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking: 3
2. Ruby Syntax & Standard Library: 3
3. Rails Syntax & API: 3
4. Rails Style: 3
5. Testing: 3
6. Collaboration: 3

####Notes

Worked well with me. Collaborated well. Didn't do anything out of the ordinary or spectacular with testing, but did not have any bad practices. Same for rails syntax. We did try to use some tools he had not used before and was comfortable with implementing them. Overall decent work. Has room for improvement that we spoke about but is in a good place overall.

###Projects

##Team

###Projects

####Traffic Spy
[GitHub](https://github.com/jbrr/traffic_spy)

[Assignment](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/traffic_spy.html)

In this project, we implemented Google Analytics type functionaily using
ActiveRecord, Sinatra, and Postgres. I was in a group with Mimi, Mike, and Alon.

We were evaulated by Josh M.:

#####Scores

1. Functional Expectations          : 3
2. Test-Driven Development          : 4
3. Encapsulation / Components       : 3
4. Fundamental Ruby & Style         : 3
5. Sinatra / Web and Business Logic : 3
6. View Layer                       : 4

#####Feedback from Group

"Jeff may seem quiet but when he does speak up, it's obvious that he's been attentive and contemplative about the problems at hand. He was more than willing to contribute when he felt like it would be helpful. He was also great at looking for solutions to problems without being asked."

"Nope. Jeff is pretty chill and fun to be around."

(I'm not sure who sent that feedback, that's all Mike sent me when I asked.)

####Little Shop of Orders - Denvestments

[GitHub](https://github.com/jbrr/denvestments)

[Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown)

In this project, we built an ecommerce store from the ground up. The idea was
to make a microlending platform for local startups and causes. I was in a group
with Chris, MB, and Russell.

We were evaluated by Mike:

#####Scores

* Feature Completeness: 3
* Views: 3
* Controllers: 3
* Models: 4
* Testing: 4
* Usability: 3
* Workflow: 4

#####Notes

* Good use of jQuery.
* Some user flow could be better, needs some UX enhancements on the admin dashboard side.
* 60 tests
* 100% test coverage
* Well written tests

#####Feedback from Group

######Russell

You are super easy to be friends with. This won't come as a surprise to anyone for me to say, but you are very soft-spoken. It's a bit hard to get opinions out of you, but I thought everything you said was valuable. (Our whole team seems to have that trait.) It is cool to work with you, because it's fun to see you get excited about things. I think you should try not to worry as much. I'm happy that you're in my module. You definitely did your share of the work.

######MB

 I really enjoyed working with you. You bring a good energy to a group because you are able to stay positive and calm in the face of challenges and frustrating moments. I think we couldâ€™ve solved some of our issues faster (i.e. paperclip) had we asked for help sooner, but I think your willingness to muddle through led to some good learning for all of us. I guess make sure you are striking a healthy balance between learning from the struggle and asking for support. You are a clear communicator and a strong coder. I learned a lot from you.

##Community

###Playing a Part

On August 20, I helped lead the orientation session for the incoming 1508
students. On the same day, I helped move furniture before and after the carpet
cleaners worked.

On August 25, Daisha recognized Adam Caron's and my efforts to reinvigorate my
posse, calling it "an inspiration".

On September 4, a pull request I submitted was accepted to the Ruby Exercises
repository making hash_test.rb more clear for beginners.

I helped George plan and host the Turing Kids Who Code class. I regularly attended
planning meetings, and although I missed the first class, I helped out at the
September 26th session, and have signed up for the October 10th session.

## Review

### Notes

( Leave blanks for reviewers )

### Outcome

## A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations.

* 3: Student achieved a "3" or better on each category of the assessment

## B: Individual Work & Projects

A Turing student works to maximize their skill growth and demonstrates
that skill across a variety of work.

* 3: Student demonstrates commitment and growth in their work through satisfactory
evaluations of each project or a clearly upward-sloping trend.

## C: Group Work & Projects

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, and delivers a high-quality product.

* 3: Student fully participates in their group work to facilitate group harmony
while achieving consistently satisfactory results.

## D: Community Participation

A Turing student builds up the community around them by participating and
supporting other students, the larger Turing family, and persons outside our
walls who want to develop their own skills.

* 4: Student has a significant positive impact on the learning and spirit of the
people around them.

## E: Peer & Instructor Feedback

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.

* 3: Student consistently delivers meaningful feedback for peers and implements
strategies to improve themselves in response to feedback.
