** Attendance

This module I attended all days and classes on-time.

** Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

*** IdeaBox

IdeaBox was a basic CRUD app in Javascript only (no frameworks). It was challenging and was remininiscent of a dumpster fire.

Original Assignment: https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/revenge_of_idea_box.markdown
Production URL: https://ideaboxer.herokuapp.com/

Points: 142

*** Thoughtbox

Thoughtbox was the practice final assessment.
I completed the first 4 iterations very quickly... and then was stuck on iteration 5 for the remainder of the day.

Points: 60

*** Realtime

I built a polling app with similar functionality to strawpoll.me
It can generate new fields dynamically.
And does all of the things in jQuery (a weakness for me before this project).

** Team Projects

*** Game Time (Chess Trainer)

This project was inspired by Steve... I wanted to build an RTS and he said that would be ridiculous... so then I said I wanted to build Chess...
and he said I wouldn't be able to ship it... at that point it was done. I was definitely building Chess.
Before we ever started working on the product we wanted to build it out to be a Chess Trainer (not just a Chess clone).
We were aimed at increasing users "board vision" over time by optimizing "reaches".
The way to do this: force users to click a square first and then have them choose from a selection of pieces that can move to that square.
The reaching moment is when they decide they want to move to a square... and then the immediate feedback is the index of pieces.

** Feedback to Me

From George =>
Justin could use some help getting motivated about anything. It’s depressing how low energy he ALWAYS is.
Wait… I mean the reverse of all that. I knew working on chess was going to be a big challenge, but holy crap it was fun!
Justin and I worked very well together and we always listened to each other, even when we disagreed. We had a simulated running tally on who was right about things. I won.
But I may be wrong about that and Justin’s tally++ To be frank, Justin has some ambitious ideas, but always follows them up with the energy to see them actualized.

From Jeff =>
Justin, I love working with you, your constant enthusiasm is such an asset to me, and to the cohort in general. When you’re not in class, I feel like nobody is as good as they can be.
I know people joke about it, but the fact that everything is “the most awesome thing ever” is really valuable, and it makes me more excited to work and to figure things out.
I think it's great that you continue to work on your game time app, and your aspiration to integrate web sockets to make it real time, it inspires me to improve my own game (mobile? touch controls? awesome!).
That said, I'd say the biggest thing to work on is to follow through with those aspirations, and make sure they happen. I've seen you do that at times in your personal life with goals that you've set for your time here, so keep working on that!

From MB =>
You are one of the hardest people for me to really think of genuine advice for. You are one of the most curious, thirsty for learning people I’ve ever met. I love coming in the morning, and seeing you diligently taking notes from POODR.
Part of what’s helped me really grasp things has been standing next to you while you take amazing notes and ask great questions. You never mind when I ask you to stop listening for a second and clarify something I missed.
I appreciate that you’ve really focused on doing your best to take care of yourself too, and be a better person outside of programming. Because you’re always so damn happy and enthusiastic, it’s hard to tell sometimes how you’re dealing or if things are ever hard.
My advice, then, would be to let people know when things are shitty sometimes and make sure you have a good support network for that. Find things that are genuinely really hard, that you just don’t get, and maybe try thinking about a project in a new way, and take a different approach.
I think you’ll be an amazing mentor, and I hope that’s something you can give back to Turing!

From Matt Ewell =>
I said it at the end of module one and I'll say it again, I'm really glad Justin decided to repeat the module and join 1507. He made being in echo almost bearable. I like how Justin always has a good attitude, no matter what might be going on. It's inspiring the way he takes on challenges.
Some of us would never be able to challenge ourselves as much as Turing does-- I don't think that's the case for him. As for anything to improve, I would say perhaps empathizing with the user more.
He wrote an awesome chess game, but it wasn't immediately clear that the controls were (intentially) different from your average computer chess game.
I know I suffered sometimes on assignments, especially in mod one, because I wanted to handle all kinds of user input and give meaningful feedback to the user and such, so it's definitely a balance, and erroring on the side of writing something cool that's technically challenging is probably a good move. But we're supposed to throw a potential item for improvement out there so there you go.

** Giving Feedback

George =>
George is pleasant to work with… and I’m reasonably sure he actually sees the entire world in X/Y coordinates.
Working on Chess Trainer with him was the highlight of this module for me.
He was quick to understand what we were trying to do. Was never arrogant about ideas.
The biggest idea for improvement: Focus on practicing your hard skills (typing, hotkeys, workflow, etc). You already have an exceptionally good base to try things but being able to work faster will pay dividends down the road.

Jeff =>
Jeff is an amazing guy. Humble and down to earth and yet clearly VERY talented. Seeing all of his projects come to fruition and start to blosson has been very exciting!
He's quick to understand ideas and new concepts.
The two times we've had the opportunity to pair together have both been excellent!
In terms of areas for improvement: The biggest thing would be to focus on inner discipline (something I practice myself). Since you tend to grasp new things so quickly it can
become tiring to follow through with the more mundane things... and thats where discipline and habit come in!
Overall, its been really great getting to know you!

MB =>
Seeing your journey from almost no experience whatsoever to a professional bad ass has been awesome!
You have a dynamite combination of perseverance, persistance and maybe a little bit of stubborness thrown in for good measure.
You were definitley one of the hardest workers in the cohort and seem to be extremely disciplined (I remember talking to you about spending money
and you said you hadn't bought a lunch at turing yet... at all).
If I could offer you feedback for improvement I would say to not get intimidated by some of the more "data sciency" things. They aren't harder than the stuff
you've already been learning and you definitely have the brain power to figure it out!
Overall, great job these 7 months. You have great things in store for you!
